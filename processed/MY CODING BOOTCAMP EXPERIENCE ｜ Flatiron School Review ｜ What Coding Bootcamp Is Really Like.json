{"video_title": "MY CODING BOOTCAMP EXPERIENCE \uff5c Flatiron School Review \uff5c What Coding Bootcamp Is Really Like", "transcript": "hello everybody my name is nya and i'm the black female engineer and today we are going to be discussing my coding bootcamp experience which is really going to also be a flatiron school coding bootcamp review as well so getting right to it i started my coding bootcamp june 29th last week of june i started the and the first thing that struck me were the class sizes before because i'm pretty sure you know this is going to to really make sure that we're all on the same page because of this whole parallelogram i was on line but that doesn't mean in the selection of you know what kind of course are you doing that doesn't mean that i chose an online course i didn't choose that program this was still the in person but because of everything going on it was through zoom so live sessions through zoom rather than if you chose an online bootcamp it would be non-live sessions um it would be more self-paced and so this was really as in person as it can be without being in so first thing that struck me were the class sizes they were smaller than i envisioned i don't know if that is typical for flat iron school or anything like that oh yeah i don't think i mentioned i went to flatiron school that is the coding bootcamp i went to for four months and it was specifically the software engineering uh coding bootcamp or the software engineering course so i don't know if 15 people was typical was a typical class size for them it might have or might not have because maybe people decided to hold off on going into coding boot camp because of this whole panoramic going on but you know what a year later you should have just joined the boot camp because look at where we are but um it's not too late like please if you want to like do something like just go out do it do it now because you don't know how long things are going to last but yeah so it's 15 people and now the second thing that really struck me was the two women in the entire cohort one of them being myself and so i was kind of expecting this like i do know that you know the tech world and software engineering really in particular is very male dominated i do understand that but i don't know y'all like still being in there and still seeing just like the one female face i was still kind of like come on like let's do better than this but you know what on the bright side you know that was an instant you know homie an instant best friend for the cohort so you know it things work out you make the best of any situation but it was um that is something that did strike me was the youngest person in the boot camp i'm 22 years old and i'd want to say the average age i wasn't you know too skewed but i'd say the average age was about 29 between 29 and 31 yeah like in between there um like it seems like you know everyone i was with you know had full-blown husbands and wives and children they had full-blown you know lives of people to be accountable for and meanwhile i'm over here pressing play for the zoom in my you know onesie and everything so you know that was something that did make me nervous because i was just like geez like how are they going to look at me like they're going to not take me seriously they're not going to you know think i'm skilled enough or they think you know what overwhelmingly like that was honestly all just like a moot point like we were all in here for the same reason we were trying to switch from one industry to the next and we were all make wanting to make sure that we got through it so for the most part like that really wasn't a you know a big factor um and it shouldn't be a deterrent to anyone who may feel like an outlier um because at the end of the day like y'all we're all just trying to make sure we succeed and get through this and that very much was the vibe that's another thing i felt going in like i thought that it would be like the hunger games like the whole vibe was like fight to the finish like move out of my way each person for themselves but it was not like that at all like even like like eight days in i was over here having um just like a one-on-one zoom session with one of my classmates who was helping me get through um one of the topics that i was struggling on and this was at like 8 p.m we spoke for like an hour and a half and everything it was very much a thing of we are all to make sure to get through this now that being said you know only half of us got through it um we only half of us made it to our original you know graduation date and all but you know what coding bootcamp is hard and people you know lean off of it or you know decide to take a step back or anything for any number of reasons it doesn't always mean that you know they weren't you know they couldn't do it or anything like they're not smart enough they're not no it's none of that just a lot of people may realize that this isn't the path for them and just continue searching elsewhere or that you know the timing just was off so it could be for a number of reasons but i just want to make it clear or just provide that insight of the people you do start with they likely will not be the same people you end up with it's very sad and disappointing but that's just the vastness where we're at with that so now getting into what a day looked like at flattering school so we started off at around 9 00 a.m um with a morning stand up so some companies have this some schools have this but you wake up you know 9 a.m for us it was you know zoom we open our zoom and it started with and first of all like an update of how everyone's feeling how everyone's doing just like catching up and then it went into trying to gauge how the students felt about certain topics and chapters and content and the teachers really wrapping their lessons around that so that's something i absolutely loved with flatiron school the teachers really wrapped their lessons plan their lesson plans around what the students were wanting to see more of wanting to get more practice in and everything they of course had their own you know on this day we're going to learn ruby and then we're going to learn you know rails and then we're going to learn javascript and things like that but it also was okay here is what we have planned and this is you know what the schedule is going to be but if a student was like hey i'd actually also really like a repeat of yesterday's lesson or um be able to talk about this or this or this even if it wasn't even in like the syllabus like hey i really want to learn you know node or something then like a teacher would make sure to provide something for that student to really make sure they're getting out of it what they want to see because yeah that's 18 like thousand dollars you know anywhere from coding bootcamps like 12 to 20 000 so like and some more you know so and then some less but you really want to make sure you are getting out of it everything you can and as a student really making sure that you're speaking up and saying look like you need to go through this again because i don't know why but my brain is not sticking to it so please just like give me another lesson of this and they were so gracious constantly and just fantastic in that regard so that is what's kind of really um encompassed it was hey how are you how's everyone feeling and then how are we going to get through this day what are our lessons going to be looking like and then what are things that some people may specifically want and let's see how we can integrate that into the day as well then p.m was really when we were like okay like laptops off because stand down would be between like 5 15 and like 5 40. and stand down was really kind of like a repeat of the morning stand up but instead really being able to like unwind and like wind down so what did you learn today um what's something you're like thankful for what's something you'd like want to just like talk about or like in just like in your lives um and great you all did a great job and we'll see you all tomorrow this really allowed people to like have a time where they were like you know at this time i end and like laptops off because what um sometimes happens is if classes or jobs or any of the sorts if they don't do that and don't have an actual like stand down then students or you know employees just keep going and going and going because they weren't given like permission to be done and so this kind of like gave people permission to be done so that is really when the day ended and as for the day itself it was a mix between teacher led lessons where the teacher would share their screen and you know you would have your you know code pulled up and be coding along or taking notes depending on what the lesson really called for it was a mix between that and having more of like self-instruction based on like the chapters you're on and things like that i say chapters just because i feel like that's something all of us you know recognize but um what it really was was a portal where we could see all the things that we're supposed to know by which by which point in time and once you learn this you should learn this and it would have tutorials and you know actual lessons and like like chapters like like a book and so it would be a mix between switching back and forth between the teachers lessons and going to your like book and um going through that cycle and that process as well so a mix of those two getting you to that you know stand down mark so that was day to day now if you look at more like bigger picture so every third week we had a project we had to do the project was just you know building some type of app web app or an actual mobile app building some kind of app with some kind of either technology or framework or something that had been taught during the last you know three weeks so flaring school we had modules um modules like chapters think of them just as chapters where every three weeks was a new module so we had five modules in total and it went from yeah like module one being like ruby then module two being rails then module three being like javascript uh four being react and then module five was more self-guided module where you build your own app and it's something that you know you is a culmination of the last you know four months of the program so that is how things are split up and so like i said every three weeks was a different module and at the end of every three weeks we were to build a an app of some kind but then every two weeks like every second week of a module was like kind of like exam time where you kind of have to like [Music] pass the test pass a test um i say test slightly they if someone's watching this from flatiron school you know that you know they didn't like the word test it's not a test but it's a test like let's call you know a spade a spade that's you know let's see what it is it was a test and whether or not you passed it determined on if you could move on to the next module or if you were quote held back held back being that you had the option of retaking the module but if you retook the module you were held back you were now on the delay of like six weeks um because you were waiting for the next cohort to come in and now you're taking this new module with the new cohort it's very confusing um but basically yeah you're held back just like how you know if it's like ninth grade and you weren't able to pass the class and so now you're held back but you need to wait the summer um for you to join the next incoming class to join them and now you're part of their you know graduating year and everything and now that those are your people same exact um thing with flatiron you had to wait six weeks and join a new class but yeah every two weeks you had a test every three weeks you had a project so overall the things i appreciated most of flatiron i mentioned this before was the focus on the students the focus what do the students like and don't like and what are they struggling on what do they need more assistance with uh let's make sure we structure our day and our week based on assisting that or even not even struggling but what do they want to learn like okay this person wants to learn material ui like okay let's put in slots for learning just that and let's make sure a teacher is able to teach just that for the people who are interested in that and so just because something wasn't like on the like you know syllabus and everything didn't mean that we couldn't learn it that being said i don't know if that is the way for every single flatiron um like location and school and everything i was part of the denver school i don't know if that is the same case for everybody but that's how it was for me something i do wish flatiron incorporated more i'd say were would be algorithms um there really wasn't a ton of time to incorporate algorithms into the structure because yeah it's a very fast turnaround um with this boot camp and everything and so sometimes he just didn't have but you know if it was a perfect world i do wish there had been a module just dedicated to algorithms so that you know when you get to the interviewing process and things like that you felt more prepared rather than you were on your own we were never on school i'll say that but yeah feeling like you are now doing this by yourself and having to learn this other side of things just so you can get a job even though you may not even work with specific algo stuff and things like that so that is something i do um wish in a perfect world had been incorporated but in general i loved flatiron school i would if the tuition was double i still would have paid it knowing what i know now and i ended up getting a job just three weeks after graduation my first offer was just a few hours after graduation and i ended up getting a job just signing on the job i really really wanted three weeks after graduation so they prepared me very well i'd say and i'm very grateful so there we go there is my coding bootcamp experience and my overall review on flat iron school so please subscribe if you like this video i'm really trying to get to 100 subscribers so please help me out there and there is going to be a video coming to you soon so now thank you bye y'all"}
