{"video_title": "Q&A \uff5c CODING BOOTCAMP, JOB INTERVIEWS, HOW TO GET A JOB AS A SOFTWARE ENGINEER", "transcript": "that is not true at all those people can mind their own business and if you have a job then you have a job if you don't have a job it's not because of me it's i can i can assure you of that hello everybody my name is nyan i'm the black female engineer i provide content for you an aspiring software engineers and today we are going over y'all's questions i'll be answering questions 10 of y'all had for me about coding bootcamp jobs and interviews and whatnot and so yeah we're gonna get right to it but please if you see anything in the background i just moved and so things are everywhere so if you see something in the background just remind your business but no let's get into it so the first question comes from jordan thomas i'm gonna be looking down on my laptop and jordan thomas asks as someone who is currently enrolled in flatiron i'm just curious what was the hardest concept for you to grasp something that you may still not have down a hundred percent yet and may have a mild panic attack whenever you are forced to work with it mine would definitely be react it took me a long time for me to feel like i finally grasped it enough and really was because of the flow react has in development it's very powerful it's great for large teams and there are so many benefits to however when it came to my brain it took longer for me to understand that flow of things and so that did just slow me down a lot you mentioned here that you're having trouble with javascript javascript did trip me up a lot when i was first learning specifically with dealing with on click um functions and rendering things onto the screen and making things persist oh my goodness that was really really my biggest struggle when i was learning javascript the like just the vanilla and really what i recommend is doing building burns that's what i did always till sunday i would look up the lectures that my instructors posted and you said you're in finance school i imagine your instructors post the lectures they do or the recordings and i would look at them and build along and then i would demolish it all down and then try again without looking at anything see how far i got and really this would help me see really what part of my struggle um like why i'm struggling with things and what part of the things i'm struggling with rather than saying oh javascript is hard being able to say oh it's hard for me to render things properly onto a page and because that was the part that would always stop at and so that's something i really really recommend and hopefully this helps the next question comes from aaron nostradna and they asked you posted a video a few weeks ago calling out the interview process for asking very technical and very advanced questions to candidates seeking entry-level developer positions why do you think this happens i personally think that it happens because large companies like the you know the fame companies like the facebooks the googles they had created this technical interview that's so advanced so large because you know their companies are so advanced and so large and so they created that but i feel like it ended up trickling down to now mid-sized companies and small companies because it became this i don't even know it became this like show of like machoness and this show of advancement and wow we're so great and let's see if we can get past this level and so that was kind of the gatekeeping mechanism that these top companies had and so now middle mid size and small companies i feel like wanted that same oomph to them that same type of exclusivity um that those companies had and so they start adopting more difficult technical interview processes as well and your question here you mentioned that you think it's because they want to hire a more advanced person for entry-level roles that way they have more of like a mid-level person but paying them a very beginner salary as a really good thought i don't i'm sure it happens but i don't imagine that's the reason why widespread that these companies are giving really hard technical interviews because there is no shortage of developer roles in this country especially now there's no shortage and they are willing to pay top dollar for them and so if you're a developer who ends up in a role like this where they're paying you nothing to employ these major type roles even though you're an entry level well you would just leave you know what i mean you would just leave and then the company is back to recruiting and recruiting is not cheap y'all recruiting is expensive and so i don't imagine that's the overarching reason just because there's so many jobs out there that will pay you the fair wage that the company at the end of it would be the losers of the situation not the developer not the worker and so i can't imagine that that's the overarching reason and i can't imagine my reason is the overarching reason either to be complete like this is just my thought process a study came out showing that if you gave these fang interviewers the problem that they're giving you they too would not be able to solve it without hard preparation beforehand now i'm not saying don't prepare i'm not saying but just to give you some minds like just to give you some insight into the whole interviewing and show you how hard it is where even if you worked there and were on these teams or on these projects you still wouldn't be able to solve these problems without months and months of preparation and so i definitely believe the technical interview process really needs a reboot and a revamp more and more companies have kind of gone away with this because at the end of the day i can teach you how to write an if statement but i can't teach you to be a person i want to work with to be a good employee to be a person that contributes positively to this you know workspace and so more and more companies are getting away with are getting giving way um and just not paying too much mine to technical interviews now but no it is not no no no next question comes from gigi who asks i looked up grants to attend boot camps and only found um limited choices like flatiron only tuesdays offer grants for women i would love you to talk more on how to get grants so that's interesting that when you looked up grants from finance only two states showed up um and i imagine you're you mentioned that because you know that i got a grant to attend flatiron i i received i think it was a three thousand dollar grant last year to attend flat-out school i did not know this was not a widespread grant um it was only available in a few campuses however flat iron now just launched a campaign where they are offering the women take tech grants and so it's available for anyone identifying as a woman looking to get into flatter for either software engineering or data analysis or they have so much y'all they have cyber security they have now trying to go off memory they have cyber security they usui developments they have so so many options the grant is for up to three thousand dollars and so hopefully now i know you wrote this question before the campaign launched and so hopefully with that you can get some ease and whatnot i'll provide a link in my description box below so that you can go straight to learn more about the campaign and the grant and really all you do is apply you then will get your voice that you want to receive that grant you want some money to get you through this because y'all is not cheap it is that cheap so hopefully that helps you out but in general i highly recommend just googling in general seeing okay what companies what organizations are willing to sponsor me to go through coding boot camp searching yeah coding boot camp grants for women coding boot camp sponsorships for people of color for women of color the lgbtq community sometimes a little bit more research is needed to really really find um the right grants and sponsorships and scholarships for you but hopefully some weight is taken off your shoulder when you go to the description box go see my link and you get to learn about the grant they're currently offering nationwide next question is from michelle wesson who asks did flatiron offer you any assistance finding your first job do they help you get interviews so i'm going to answer the question in two parts so flat iron definitely helps you in your getting a job journey after you complete your 15 weeks of learning you then are moved on to the more career-minded um like group they have a whole career section division i can't think of the correct term but they have people whose job it is to be your counselor and help you get to that job it's not just your instructor giving you advice after hours like no it's a legit division that you get to have weekly meetings and go through tech mock interviews go through behavioral lock interviews they review your resume and all of these different checklist items they really do so much to help however with me if you are familiar with my journey i started applying to jobs a solid six weeks after starting coding boot camp and so by the time i graduated and was moved to the career division of things i already was like i almost had my third interview for some positions so and then i believe about a week or two weeks later i had signed on an offer so they didn't help me because they didn't have the opportunity to help me i had already like been like no this is the way i am doing this one two three and i was able to get a job i was able to actually get my first job offer on my graduation day and so no they didn't help me because i didn't give them the chance to however they have a whole division like i said aimed at helping you and one reason i chose flatiron this is important to note is because they have such a robust partnership um partnerships with other companies where if you tell them i'm looking for front-end developer roles at a mid-sized company they'll be able to steer you in some type of direction and hopefully even connect you with those people or be able to now when they hear of a job opening up or a physician opening up they will contact you i remember my counselor would email me directly like yo you said you are x y and z well here you go and then i responded sorry girl i forgot to tell you i got a job but they do that and so that's something i love with flat and watch ultimately made me made the decision for me because learning how to code is great but what good is it if you don't get a job afterwards and so yes they definitely do help and they really really put the time in for you next question comes from chai n who asks do you network within your field if so how what is your favorite way of networking has it ever helped you land a job so i'm quite an introvert i'm quite the and so there have been many opportunities for me to network with like slack groups and different channels um and happy hours and virtual happy hours because you know this whole parent-teacher conference is still among us and so there are opportunities too and is highly recommended i personally have been like lacking have been slacking in this i i plan to get better i'll take this question as a sign for me to do better but i highly recommend networking to get jobs in general i what i did when i was looking for a job was every time i found a job that i liked i would go on linkedin and find someone in that company to talk to and i would just do a cold call basically where i'll just blindly message them ask for a few minutes of their time and we would just talk about the position and i would ask them questions and so that was my way of networking but that was when i was looking for a job and it's great to network when you don't need a job because when you do need a job you've already formed these robust connections with your with the people around you the people in your field because people can see right through it when you're just networking because you need your bills paid like people can see through that and they're i don't think they're they'd be more less willing to help but it's just less fun because it's like okay will this person just dip after they get the job and so it's better to network when you don't need it that way when you do need it you haven't you have those relationships and so no i highly recommend slack channels i remember my um city had like a deaf community for that city and so look those up also facebook groups are fantastic look up yeah software developer in minneapolis or wherever you are or you know people of color and tech or things like that and see what facebook's facebook groups you can join and be active be ask for one-on-one meetings ask for advice and help and for people to just drink calls and whenever you have the opportunity to join a call or join a virtual happy hour or go to a conference really really take that opportunity because a person's network especially in this field can really be everything chai and you also ask if you could choose another area or field of tech which one would you choose for a career i personally would choose a i i think that is such an interesting tech realm and when we look at the history of a.i it's very much been dominated by one type of person one type of developer and so i think it would be great to have a voice in that because when there's not a large pool of diverse mindsets going into something problems arise y'all you can see that a little bit ago i actually read a study that showed how self-driving cars are less likely to identify people of color in the streets a car cannot identify me not cannot but is less it's harder for it to identify that is a problem that's a life or death problem sometimes people can see diversity in the workplace everything tech as like oh because it's like the right thing to do and oh it's because like we're trying to be good people like no it's because it can create life or death situations having diversity in the workplace because if we had a person of color part of these decisions part of these different things then they would think about that they would i would think that they would say you know what would be nice if the car saw me walking down the street so it didn't hit me i think that yeah so that's what i have to say about that if you'd like to know more about this i highly recommend watching coded bias on netflix it's an amazing movie that really goes into this topic going into the studies that have been done and really the widespread implications um of a lack of diversity in the ai realm so i really recommend that but no that's really why i would be a part of it to kind of also just fix it from the inside you know um being this you know like trojan horse just going in then you know let's let's fix this and so yeah that definitely would be the field i would be in one i and desmond ray asked what are the top three things to do before entering coding bootcamp one is to identify each and every stressor in your life no matter how big no matter how small is it your job is it your man's is it your parents is it your child crying in the background identify every single stressor in your life and then figure out a solution for each of them is it is it your job okay can you work for the next x amount of months really save up and then quit so that when you get your coding bootcamp you can just focus on community bootcamp is it your baby can you talk to your partner and or your family members and ask okay from these hours these hours can you be the sole caretaker so that i can focus on my education if it's your man's can you break up with can you bring up with them i i mean like i'm i'm half kidding but truly that is also an important consideration i think many of us can attest to the um what you'll call it the damage that being in a relationship with a person who is not not supportive of you and your goals and you only add stress even the best of times how that um that's not the best place to be in no matter what and so now think about your future goals including boot camp and everything maybe shoot maybe it's time to split fast i don't know but no truly seriously see what stressors you have in your life literally no matter how big my how small and formulate a plan to resolve each of them so that's number one because with coding bootcamp it's really stressful like i had like the things i did to make sure that i could succeed um pat and get a job after returning boot camp and have the most seamless transition possible and still it wasn't a seamless transition still it's hard and it's intense and it's so so emotional but i moved in with my parents so that i wouldn't have to worry about bills or feeding myself or rent i reached out to my friend saying hey for the next like three to four months you may not hear from me and so like please don't take it personally but i'm in the zone so please like i'm sorry and so i truly took that seriously and so i'm saying like really take that seriously write that list and figure out um plans for a resolution for each of them so that's number one that's the biggest thing for me to be honest once you have this i think you're in a pretty good spot i can't even can i think of two more things two contact your friends and family tell them the journey you're about to embark on um and that you would like their support and thanking them for um yeah the future support that they'll be giving you and three three establish a solid linkedin account um that way you're not doing it while you're at boot camp because while you're at bootcamp you want to keep updating your status and your projects on linkedin because so many people can see that and linkedin like sure maybe none of your connections are developers but their connections might be and their and so it's a great way to like get your projects and portfolio out there and for more people to see that no you're serious about this and seeing ways to assist you on that path so yes make your list contact friends and family and create a robust linkedin account so that once you do start you post regularly about the projects you've built and um yeah just keeping people updated on your journeys that when you do start looking for a job then there's this because recruiters look at linkedin also not just github not just your resume they also look at linkedin and so when you do start looking for a job they go to your linkedin and see all the things you've already done or people connect with you based on based on you wanting to be in this field you also ask explain some of the tickets or requests you would have to do at your job really tickets came down to two things bug fixes and enhancing the current apps and correct me if i'm wrong i imagine that's what most tickets would be for any developer um outside of the oh do this type of managerial task if we're talking tech focus i imagine there would all be bug fixes or enhancements bug fixes so hey when people try to add things to their shopping cart the number that appears on the shopping cart isn't the right number of things that are actually in their cart and so bug fixes or saying hey let's start adding this type of carousel banner to the home page that displays five products at a time and i want it done by monday and so yeah enhancements or bug fixes and these two examples are examples of tickets i actually did go through when i was working in congress cloud development now however i'm in a whole new job i actually just finished day two of orientation and i'm actually filming the day i'm going to be posting this and so it really is day two of orientation for me and so soon i'll be sharing more about the tickets i experienced and my work day and what i do and so that answer will change uh soon but the overarching yeah bug fixes and enhancement okay so next question comes from at mz underscore tommy who asked before landing a job how much knowledge of programming do i need to have that's a hard question what i will say is i did not have any programming experience before coding boot camp i had self-taught for about a month and a half to two months and i was hired right at the end of my coding bootcamp and so in total it was about six months of learning um both self-taught and encoding boot camps six months total that i was learning before i got hired and so i will say coding bootcamp really did provide me with all the skills necessary to at least get a junior level position to get a better understanding of what skills you need if you aren't looking to go to a coding bootcamp bookcamper and are just trying to be self-taught i highly recommend looking up junior developer positions and taking note of the skill sets and requirements that are listed on each of the different job postings and then try to see if you see some type of pattern in each of them and that is a good way to know what's expected for you to learn in search of the wording say yeah junior developer junior software engineer front end developer backhand developer full stack developer entry level full stack developer things like that switch up the wording because sometimes different things pop up for different things even though it's really the same title so yeah switch it up and see if you can see any type of pattern next comes from i think you pronounce it at kelly achilles um who asked how perfect should a portfolio project be i i do go over some of this in my previous videos where i go over the five portfolio projects to have and also i go over my specific portfolio projects the ones i had on my resume to get to my job and so i highly recommend you look at those two but overall if they have pretty you know good crud functionalities i think that's great crud stitch for create read update delete so if it's a blog app can a person create a new blog can a person read something um that's already been posted can a person update a previous posting and they can they delete a posting they had uh the blog example is really the best example for the crud functionalities but if you think about things like instagram you can create a post you can read other people's posts you can update on your current posting like edit it um and you can delete photos and things like that and so yeah do they have basic crud functionalities if they do then you're a pretty great spot specifically for junior level slash entry level positions but i highly recommend you check out those two videos i'll link them below and above so that you can yeah easily look at them but overall it doesn't need to be perfect but you wanted to have those functionalities and you also wanted to be pretty i know so a lot of people kind of put css to the wayside because they're like oh it's not important it's not actual development and whatnot well maybe it's not you know super applicable to the jobs you want but at the end of the day when people are looking at your portfolio it sucks but we humans we judge books by they're covered the whole reason don't judge a book by its cover is a saying is because people do it you know what i mean people have a problem with that and so you want to make sure styling isn't the reason that people aren't bringing you into and for interviews because this tiling threw them off so much that they didn't even bother with the rest of the app and so just make sure things are like packaged nicely but don't focus too much on the packaging where functionalities and features aren't there because yeah it looks pretty but it does nothing and so it's nice to have a good balance at rambling mind show asks what is one thing that you've always wanted to do that you can finally do i imagine you mean like because of my new career and for me one thing that i can finally do to me it's financial um security i know that's maybe basic but it's a big thing for me growing up for people who have known me that was somewhat of a struggle um or a fear i think is a better word um the lack thereof and so being able to be in a position where i'm like wow i'm in a new apartment and i just bought my first car and i am planning trips and vacations that's something i truly don't take for granted or i try not to at all because i it really means a lot to me and so that is a big one for me i try not to cry but that's truly a big one for me and so i'm really excited to see how things develop for me as the days weeks months and years go on and then last question comes from ebony nelson and girl okay there's a couple there's a couple questions here um so i'm gonna try to get through them all but your first question is is the market desperate for developers right now or is it flooded with developers quick and easy answer yes they need developers the market is not flooded with developers i know for me when i was thinking about coding boot camp that was a fear of mine that shoot people keep saying that coding boot camp grabs are just diluting the market and all of this that is not true at all those people can mind their own business and if you have a job then you have a job if you don't have a job it's not because of me it's i can i can assure you of that um and so no don't if that's the reason why you ask then no don't give into this at all the market is not flooded with developers 2020 especially made the market skyrocket with developers actually wrote it down and dave reported that there was a growth in software developer roles of 22 where other roles were at a mere 4 and so no they need developers 2020 really made companies invest more in technologies that would allow people to do things like work from home or consumers to experience products from home and all that jazz and so with this big need now for software and good technology so many developers were are needed now more than ever so no like get it girl i don't think that you won't have a job because there's just all these developers and whatnot no don't think that at all your next question is when you're applying for jobs did you apply for jobs that had a degree requirement and five to ten years of experience i'm asking because i was looking for jobs this morning and i put myself in a box looking for entry level positions and there were only 25 that were entry level so i applied entry level yes but i also applied to jobs that would say like one to three years of experience or two to three years of especially if i saw that these skills and qualifications noted other than the years of experience matched my skill set i think that people especially women often disqualify themselves before anyone else gets the chance to i saw this other stat that was like and i i don't remember the specific numbers the percep the specific percentages so don't quote me on them but the idea was that men will apply to a job when they fit let's say 50 of the skill sets noted in the posting while women will apply to a job when they fit 80 or more percent of the skill sets noted and so like come on no no and so at the end of the day i will learn and so if i am lucky enough to get an interview for a job that requires more experience than i have i will not shy away from that topic i'll say look i don't have experience in mongodb but i'm so excited to learn look at how much i was able to learn in such a more in such a short amount of time i am even more eager to learn this with you all and so no at the end of the day like i said they can teach you you know sql and mongodb and if statements they can't teach you to be a good person and to be a hard worker and so no don't let those qualifications um trip you up from applying at least apply you know at least apply uh but what i will say is i did stop at the three-year mark whenever i asked for more than three years that's when i kind of cut it and so yeah focus more on the skill sets needed and if you see that they match yours really well don't only apply but make sure your resume very clearly shows those skill sets so that when they do go through it they see that okay so they don't have as much as many years of experience we want but look at all the technologies and all of the qualifications they have as noted in their resume you also ask which websites did you use looking for jobs i typically used like just google.com i would say junior software engineer front-end developer back in developer full stack and i would filter out um accordingly based on the things i wanted because when you do look through google itself basically its own kind of portal pops up and you can filter out based on the things you want do you want it to be in milwaukee to be full time to be part time etc and so that's mostly what i did but what i also did was i did make a list of about 20 companies that i really love and would want to work for and so after i made that list i went on the company's actual pages and went on to their career page looked up positions that i might qualify for and so i did the two things i hear indeed is great for applying to jobs i never use indeed but i do have friends and family members members that do and they really like indeed as well they say it's very easy and so i recommend checking that out as well and then your last question is do you think it's better to finish your coding bootcamp before applying to jobs or is it better to wait until after boot camp is done i personally think it is better to start applying before boot camp is over as long as you have everything adequately prepared like your resume your linkedin your github all of those things because when you apply there's like a solid two to six weeks that you just don't hear anything back even if you get an interview there's solid weeks that you're just sitting there turning your thumbs and so why in my mind why would you wait until the end of boot camp to experience that weight you know what i mean i would rather apply before i end boot camp and then now for those two to four to six weeks i'm still going through boot camp i'm still applying to jobs and then by the time boot camp is over hopefully by then i start hearing back about interviews and things like that i did say that i did start applying about six weeks after my boot camp started i don't know if i would run i would do this again what i will say is if you do do that make sure you're not targeting companies that are your like dream job because odds are you're very new to this i was very new to this and so i didn't even really know what the lay of the land was and so it's better to if you do apply way early like that to do companies that you kind of wouldn't really cry to bed at night if you didn't hear back from and just to get that practicing of filling out the applications and interviewing and talking with people and networking and whatnot but in general i think it is great to maybe start applying a couple of weeks at least before your boot camp ends that way yeah when your boot camp ends you're not just there waiting for the jobs you just applied to but there we go everybody our q a session is over thank you so much to everyone who reached out who asked me questions on instagram on youtube make sure you do follow me on instagram because i will um sometimes answer questions just like on the fly there and so my instagram handle is at the black female engineer make sure you follow me make sure you like this video and subscribe if you liked it if you liked it but thank you so much i'm so excited to share more things with you soon i told you it's day two of orientation just ended and so i'm pumped for what's about to be shared and whatnot but no i hope you all have a great rest of your day and i'll see you all later bye"}
