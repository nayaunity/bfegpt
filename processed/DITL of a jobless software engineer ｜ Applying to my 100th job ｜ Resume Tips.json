shirt but yeah let me get dressed I got the cutest shirt delivered let me show you I think that's what I'm going to wear look at this shirt [Music] I am in love with this shirt it's very comfortable I'm going link down below where I got it this just Creator who makes shirts of African countries and she just did her latest drop which included Zimbabwe which makes me so happy cuz Zimbabwe is seldom included in a lot of things I see so no I love it um so this is what we're going to do today we're applying to our 100th job today we're at around 79 jobs applied to in the span of 5 days so we're going to apply to 21 More Today Show y'all how I got it to be like you know clean and crisp so that you can apply to as many jobs as possible while still being smart because quality still matters you know let's talk about that some more while I make some food because I am starving one of the best ways to personalize your resume so that each job you apply to gets like the best version of your resume without having to spend all that time doing on each and every job like redoing your resume for each and every job is by personalizing your resume for each type of job you're applying for you can do this in a number of ways the way that I decided to do it was do it based on the role I'm applying for so I am a software engineer however there are multiple different niches within software engineering there's backend engineer front end engineer there's full stack there's also ux developers there's Cloud developers all of those different things and so I looked at okay what are the different types of roles that given my experience and projects and things that I like to do in general can apply to so that came down to four different uh resum\u00e9s so for me I have a software engineer SL full stack resume frontend developer resume a ux developer resume and an iOS mobile developer resume another way you can do this is by creating resum\u00e9s for the industries you're going to apply to so let's say you are an iOS Developer and so that is fully just what you are applying to no matter what however because of your experience and background maybe educational background for me I studied finance and whatnot you may find yourself applying to the same type of job but at different Industries in finance so fintech Health Tech mediate Tech Etc and so you can also create different resum\u00e9s of the same job for different Industries this way now when you apply to a job you know it's personalized enough that you can really really go ham on the applying and spends just a couple minutes per application without having to redo your resume each time [Music] okay I am finally on my 100th application this is a good one too it is for Lift so let me put everything in here resume depends what job this is is this okay software engineer so I'll put my software engineer resume in here and we did it we did 100 job applications let me put it into my spreadsheet you see that's crazy okay hell yeah I'm going to head back to that couch over there don't calling my name and rest and scroll because that took too much time because I am tired now okay where my bathroom now because I've been trying my best to be as active as possible over the last couple of months in 2 months I've actually lost quite a bit bit of weight and really toned up but I don't feel like going to the gym which I really haven't felt this week um probably because I've been going soam on applying and job hunting i instead will opt to like walk I'll walk walk about 3 and 1/2 to 4ish Miles and that'll be my finish for the day I just try my best to just be active that day in some way I love my arms pow pow pow pow so yeah let me go about my walk [Music] okay we are back let me show you what I got it was just a quick run I needed my spinach my halo top ice cream which is literally my favorite ice cream in the world the entire higher pint is 290 calories and so what I do is I put it in between some Egos and now I have a really yummy really low calorie protein Rich dessert because I don't eat the whole pint like for an ego I'll do a third which is like 90 calories so literally the whole I can I sandwich ends up being about 200 calories I love talinis so I was like you know what for dinner I have some leftover Italian sausage pasta sauce that I'm going to heat up but I'll cook it with some talinis and I saw these online um I saw them as good protein Rich mac and cheese and I'm not like super big on Mac and cheese but this just looked really good and I'm looking for just new ways to spice up my just meals routine it's become pretty I don't know pretty stagnant and I'm trying to yeah I'm trying to switch it up because that's also like how you'll be able to stick with your Fitness routine if like you eat things that like you like and are good so hopefully this ends up like the Halo top and I actually really like it it should be 14 grams of protein from a serving and 260 no 15 grams of protein and 280 calories so I'm like no that's really good that could be a good lunch some lean ground turkey instead of ground beef and some potatoes so this is dinner this is my evening I'm very excited for it I need to a gentleman collar bought these Gorgeous Flowers for me but look how huge they are and so I'm going to cut them a little bit and add them in whatever cute container I can put inside them like like they're so pretty so yeah I'm gonna do that and get along with my evening overall this was my day and I feel like it was pretty successful so thank you so much yeah have a good night y'all [Music]"}
