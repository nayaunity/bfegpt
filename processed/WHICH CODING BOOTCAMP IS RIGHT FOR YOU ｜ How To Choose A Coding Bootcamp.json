and aspiring software engineers and today we are going to be talking about how to choose the best coding bootcamp for you now very quickly though don't forget to follow me on instagram at the black female engineer and send me your questions that you'd like me to answer in my q and a video questions about me software engineering coding boot camp all the works anything between whatever you want so let's get to it so one of the very first things you need to look at when looking at coding boot camps is what type of supporting resources supporting documents or portals they have to aid in your learning journey probably the easiest way to find out is to ask the recruiters you'll be in contact with there's likely most time a number you can just call ask them okay is there a separate portal for students where they can go through certain homework assignments is there some type of online textbook or are is it just lecture and if it's this lecture are they recorded do i have permission to record can i access them later understand what comes with all of that learning material because if we think about any school or any college we had textbooks to back things up on we had different resources portals all of that along with our own notes and things like that we also had resources that we always had access to or at least during the course and so make sure that those are in place for the boot camps you're interested in the next thing you need to do is hop onto google hop onto yelp and look at the reviews for that specific location this is so so important because there are establishments that do not have a very structured um or consistent learning environment um or program or things like that one location may be better than others one everything might be good except for one location so look at the reviews for that specific location because when you see things on websites and things like that of testimonials and stories of people who went through the boot camp you don't know which program you know they went through you don't know which you know teachers they had and everything so you don't know if these you know sentiments would be shared amongst all the students who went through the program or if it was really just for one specific course in one specific program location so look up the reviews for your specific location not just the boot camp as a whole next thing you need to ask is what job hunt resources are there in place for you do they just teach you and then let you go into the wolves and say okay pay us our 20 grand or do they have systems in place to really make sure that after you transition from being a student you are now in the hands of you know professionals who can guide you through your job hunt and look at resume reviews and look at how you do technical interviews mock interviews all of that to make sure that you are job hunt ready are those systems in place or do they just focus on the schooling itself now this next thing is important to look at because i always thought it was a given but i guess not is do they teach algorithms i came into boot camps just thinking i would you know get everything i need to know from it and especially when you don't know what you don't know you don't know what's specifically needed and what's necessary and what companies and jobs look for you just trust that this institution is going to lead you on the right path however many boot camps don't teach algorithms during the boot camp now there may be different resources they can offer for you to learn algorithms like you know the textbook they provide teaches algorithms or if you ask an instructor a ta they would teach you as well see what systems are in place to teach specifically algorithms because even if you're not you know into that side of things even if you're into let's say like more front-end design and you know the jobs you're looking at you know hopefully would assist you in learning that part of things during interviews there are many times where you would still be asked about algorithms asked about data structures even if it's not pertinent for that specific role so it's still important to know so that you can at least get through the interview process and get the job so see what they what curriculum they have for algorithms if any and if not how they subsidize that lack of you know chapter in their course next ask them how the parallelogram has affected their business their business models and their day-to-day operations this is something that's very important because i have seen and heard that certain boot camps have taken away certain offerings or certain coursework or just changed their structure after you know this panda bear has extended for now a year and so it's important to know what you would have gotten then versus what you're getting now that doesn't mean it's bad you may be getting you know better opportunities now like maybe prices are cheaper maybe you know they discounted certain things or they made certain uh programs more available and things like that so it doesn't mean it's bad but it could be bad it could be bad maybe now they don't offer the employee guarantee maybe now they don't offer income share agreements those are things that are important to know just so you understand is it better for me to go right now or is it better for me to hold off until these things come back into play so make sure you ask them how have things changed and then lastly ask about their success rate not only their success rate from you know the average of the last 20 years they've been in business but the last year specifically going with my previous point it's important to see how this panda bear has affected the job hunt process for people the learning capabilities of people the retention rate it's important to know how that has affected things and so if they're saying you know oh we have a 99 success rate it's like okay how about you know the last year and if that number drops like 60 then you know there's a problem then you know that something is wrong if they don't want to give you the number or if they say something like oh well we don't have those numbers yet it's still too early and everything ask some more probing questions how many of their graduates from the previous cohort maybe they graduated three months ago ask them how many of those graduates have jobs now that's a great way to get an idea of success rate even if they don't have the specific stats of the previous year and things like that there we go everybody make sure you ask these things and look up these things in order to really find the right match for you in terms of coding bootcamps programs or just other intensive learning programs so i hope this was helpful let me know if it was and i'll see y'all later bye"}
