{"video_title": "CODING AND COCKTAILS \uff5c Crafting a Custom Drink with JavaScript \uff5c JavaScript Function Practice", "transcript": "oh my God I did something here I might just patent this okay I need to make a cocktail not just any cocktail but a cocktail that I feel like best represents one of my best friends this is an idea I got from Tik Tok I saw this trend going around of for girls night each friend coming in with a drink that best describes their ex and so for example if there was like a really fruity drink but but it had a lot of tequila in it it'd be called like the liar or something like that because it really like it's Sneaky and you don't really taste a tequila until your job and so I was like Hey Y'all let's do a night like that but let's describe one another and I completely forgot to introduce myself I'm sorry for that my name is Nia I'm the black s engineer and I talk about tech en coding in a lifestyle way so stick around hit that subscribe button and let's make some drinks this is who I am assigned to this is who I'm going to try to bottle up into cocktail form and let's see how it goes I'm also doing this completely blind I was like I feel like it'll be more fun if I kind of just do a little scientific lab over here and see what works and then when finally I get to a concoction into a recipe I like then actually making it officially they coming in about 4 hours so I feel like that's enough time yeah let's see so what I got for this I got some Peach Moscato cuz she's cute as a peach I got tequila I got a Mescal more because I like Mescal I thought it could be a good liquor to add to this drink some proo and some dragon fruit sparkling water oh and the best thing yet that I love so much let me show youall I got some cotton candy I thought it would be really cool to shape the cotton and candy like a cloud because she's traveling always check out her Instagram freedom to explore I think it would be a cool thing to put on top of the drink as like yeah like you're always in the clouds cuz you travel so much okay I didn't buy more than I needed to for example this prco is just a little bit it's three of us girls including me coming over tonight and so I felt like this was enough I say that to say I don't have much room for error so I'm going to try the tequila first because if I do like it and if it is good with this drink maybe I won't even try with the Mescal so let's see I'm going to use this for measuring I just moved and so I actually don't have any type of measuring cup unfortunately let me start out with just the tiniest bit of tequila okay so kind of like at the halfway mark this in there I'll put a full amount [Music] right let me taste this okay no it's sweet it's [Music] sweet I'll put two let me taste this before I add in the sparkling water because I feel like how this taste will impact that decision if it's too strong I'll add some sparkling water but if it's not too strong maybe I'll go in with something else I'll I'll see cheers okay okay you can definitely taste the tequila so I will be adding in the sparkling water but it's super sweet it's really really sweet extremely peachy so no I this was this was a good decision this was a good call oh my gosh this is fantastic okay the sparkling water added just the right amount of like airiness that I want for this drink and so what I was thinking I add the C candy just like on top I'll squish it and see how it looks this looks so cute it's a lot denser than I thought it would be man I don't know the last time I had fun on [Music] Candy wow this is good okay let me take a little bit because I need it still for tonight okay let's see how would I do this does that look good it kind of looks just placed to there let me here let me do it like this maybe does that look better oh that looks good looks like a cloud right does it look like a cloud I feel like feel like it does yeah no I think that's cute okay wow I did so much better than I thought I would I really truly was just winging It Whatever ingredient I saw in the store I was like okay add that to the basket so I'm really really happy with this um so yes this is the Michin let me see how it tastes like with the con candy do I drink it do I drink it with the con candy inside or like take a piece I don't know okay well that doesn't work cuz then it just let me just blop it plop it in there oh that's cool wait a minute that's so cool I didn't think it'd look like that oh my God this is the best drink ever oh my God I did something here I might just patent this if y'all would like to try it you got the ingredients and everything I'll put them down in the description box below but I really did something there I really ate that up so Micha if you don't like it that's on you all of us are receiving a drink of what that person thinks exemplifies us so I'm really curious to see what my drink is around 6:15 I'll get all the drinks ready so that they are repaired by the time they get here and yeah hopefully it's a fun [Music] night"}
