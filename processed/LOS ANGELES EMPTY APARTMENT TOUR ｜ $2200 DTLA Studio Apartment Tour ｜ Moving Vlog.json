{"video_title": "LOS ANGELES EMPTY APARTMENT TOUR \uff5c $2200 DTLA Studio Apartment Tour \uff5c Moving Vlog", "transcript": "[Music] so it is 6 30 in the morning my flight is in like almost exactly like four hours um i am finishing up just like the very last parts of my cleaning out of my apartment so i can you know move and not get fined and whatnot um i'm very tired i'm very tired i've been up since 4 30 in the morning so it's been a hot minute up but at least i feel awake now because i woke up trying to change my flight i was so tired i was so tired um it's like let me show you what this all looks like it's nothing there's nothing here this is the living room space the kitchen is still messy so i need to fix that some of the furniture i am leaving behind because it's actually not mine i sub least subleased subletted this place from somebody is just kind enough to leave behind her items and so um over the next few days she's going to deal with removing it and everything but for the most part it's pretty empty and so yeah let me finish up the packing and get going [Music] so i finally made it to my apartment oh my gosh that was a journey i i had three so i had three bags like two check-ins a um carry-on and a purse and oh my goodness doing that by yourself is just not a good time luckily they're all the like four woolly like all-wheel drive type first suitcases um and so it made carrying like two in one hand a lot better but it definitely still was felt by you know the arms and the back um but yeah it was a smooth flight and took a lift right here i'm not the biggest fan of lax's um like process of getting a lift it's very like you have to take the shuttle to like this area it's not just you leave the airport and boom you can just catch a ride maybe it is maybe i did the wrong thing i don't know but um yes i took a lift right here my lyft driver was hilarious he started talking about like how everyone like in the lake can be claimed to be things they're not and so he was like oh like the amount of producers that you will meet here when really they're not producing anything just babies it was the funniest it was the funniest thing to me and so that really gave me the energy and um attitude i needed to get my keys and you know bring the suitcases up here look them up here and now i am in my apartment so let me give you a tour so this is the front door and so i'm going to walk over there but this is the front door so if we turn around this is what we see when we walk in on the left is the kitchen area and then on the right is the bathroom and so we'll start by going in there it's a perfectly fine bathroom the only problem with for me is that you don't get a ton of light despite what this video may say to you it's quite dark actually in here i like this that they have like a whole rack i appreciate that very much the fridge i've never seen fridge handles like this that are on this side or like a fridge that's yeah faced between so that's gonna take a bit of getting used to then here's the rest of the kitchen we have the european um like washing machine the ones that wash and dry in the same machine [Music] so these drawers i like this i like the very large established kitchen area and so if you see it from the other side this is what it looks like i like this a lot and so then to the right of the kitchen is where i think i'm going to pudge like my desk and just office area because it's just such a huge space and i love that but i'm going to go over here and show you what the rest of the apartments just like it's 750 square feet yeah i am a fan and i love these windows very large i'm interior facing as you may be able to tell but i still get like solid amount of sunshine so i do appreciate that yeah we have a nice island as a pole in the middle i think for like structural concerns or something but it's appreciated nonetheless so this area would probably be my bedroom bed area maybe not bedroom and then there's a closet over here which is a really nice size actually there's no light on the inside those are my suitcases because i just got here but there's no light inside i'll get something to you know fix that but what's shocking is there's no light and yet there's this well sir how do i turn you on i i don't understand so i'm going to see about that i was thinking about putting a desk area here too for like a vanity that way there's not two desks like out in the open [Music] so there we have it it's really just a huge open space so there's not many nicks and crannies that we need to see or check out but just for one more look here's that door the front door and there we have it so it's definitely bigger than my last place my last apartment was about 510 510 square feet so it's definitely bigger um so i do appreciate that and so yeah i'm just going to work on how to furnish it i'm trying to get most of my stuff like facebook marketplace and you know things like that so that it's not too costly because oh my gosh y'all the apartment's not cheap it is not fun having to shop for a rug that's over a hundred dollars like but why whole pillows being fifty dollars like i don't understand i'm gonna try to get some food now i have not eaten at all other than cookies my mom made me this morning and so i'm very hungry so i'm gonna try to get some food and i'll check back with you all later so i'm pretty much done for the day i got some food found this like little like place right across the corner from me but uh i think i'm gonna have to go to a property manager and fix up a few things there's just a few things i noticed with the apartment that i would like fixed um just in any place i call home really so hopefully that's good if it's not you'll hear from me um like you know just not having a great time but hopefully that's all good they're all like pretty minor i hope it's not gonna be a problem but yeah thank you for watching this move-in vlog if you hear an echo i apologize i have nothing in here other than this air mattress that i'm pretty sure is leaking um not even pretty sure it is it is because every time i get up it has shrunk about you know two inches so i might be waking up on the floor to uh tomorrow but you know what only positive thoughts only positive fives and you all help with that so thank you so much i appreciate you and i will see you all later bye"}
