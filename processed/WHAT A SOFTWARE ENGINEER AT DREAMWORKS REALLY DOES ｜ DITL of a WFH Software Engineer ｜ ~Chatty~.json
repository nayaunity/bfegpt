{"video_title": "WHAT A SOFTWARE ENGINEER AT DREAMWORKS REALLY DOES \uff5c DITL of a WFH Software Engineer \uff5c ~Chatty~", "transcript": "it's not as big as react in Jango but it's actually the little brother of D Jango that nobody knows about kind of like the little brother of Jonas Brothers that nobody knew about so that's basically flask I can't believe I just like said Jonas Brothers talking about work hello hello everybody my name is Nan I'm the black female engineer provides content for new and aspiring software engineers and welcome to my day in the life I work at Dreamworks Animation Studios I'm a software engineer and I work on the production engineering side of things and so what my team does so think about movies and DreamWorks in animation a lot of people kind of stop at the idea of okay we have animators then we have people just putting everything together and then boom we have Shrek but there's a lot of iteration that that a lot of people kind of leave out you don't just create Shrek and call it a day you create a rough sketch for the beginning days then you kind of go in do some edits you send it to people see what their comments are get back to creating Shrek and that constant rinse and repeat same thing with shots and sequences and all of that good stuff and so what we do is we provide tools and software to make that collaboration process just a lot easier for teams and so think about college when you had this team you were working on a group project and all of y'all you don't really want to keep on being the same place and with the pandemic maybe you couldn't even be in the same place and so you may have relied on Google Drive a ton Google Sheets Google Docs all of that good stuff so that one person or multiple people can be working on the exact same thing everybody can be looking at what everybody is working on make comments make edits and keep on that editing process and whatnot think of some of our tools like that basically this basically go Google Drive of okay everybody can come together look at all the different shots all the different sequences all the different characters made and whatnot make edits make comments and go back to the drawing board do what needs to be done and do it all again upload or download or Draw or all of these different things to make collaboration just a lot easier so really that's what we do we develop and we maintain those apps sometimes the apps are ours and we created them sometimes the apps are third party and we just maintain them or we enhance them in some way by building upon those features and what not and so it's very exciting I have really enjoyed this team and in my team everyone kind of has their own project everyone kind of has their own app they really focus on rather than having one team where you all work together constantly to develop the same thing or to accomplish the same goal us were're more separated out in the sense that I haven't worked with most of my team members it's a team of about 9 10 of us and I have haven't worked with most of them because they work on other different apps that me and them just don't really cross paths and so what I work on or at least what I've been working on lately I've only been working here for like two months and so what I've been working on lately is building an app to maintain the managerial tasks of teams it's making sure that yeah those managerial tasks can be done in kind of just one place rather than kind of going all around and talking to a bunch of people like hey can you do this and can you do that and I need this and I need that those managers being able to do those things on their own and so yeah throughout my day you're going to see me go through different meetings and whatnot and I'm going to come back sharing more about what I'm doing what I've been doing and yeah so I'll see you [Music] soon okay so it is now lunchtime all morning at I've been doing some debugging it's like the issue isn't really app related at all but it's an issue nonetheless and so going to be working this afternoon probably trying to S side step do some uh little bit of kind of I don't know hacking the system a little bit to get everything up and running the way it should be and so yeah it is lunchtime I'm going to go and get some I think California Pizza Kitchen baby sh and come and save me i' been missing lady look ever since she started hating I've been waking up too early I'm Miss crazy haes in the middle of the night watch the stars from different places and thees we call won't start to change you ever wake up feeling like everything strange you one St so we are back from lunch for the rest of the afternoon sorry I'm still like lunch brain for the rest of the afternoon I'll be working on the app I am you know building and you know enhancing and whatnot for this project I'm using Python and flask I had never heard of flask before I don't know how many of y'all have heard of flask before but flask is a python micro framework it's not as big as react on Django but it's actually the little brother of D Jango that nobody knows about kind of like the little brother of the Jonas Brothers that nobody knew about so that's basically flask I can't believe I just like said the Jonas Brothers talking about work but yes that's basically what flask is and it took a little bit of learning it took a little bit of getting used to but actually I was able to pick it up pretty quickly because of how micro it is as a micro framework because of that it means that you really don't need much to get things up and running and there's a lot of flexibility with it and so I actually really like it I actually like it more than I thought I would but I mentioned to you all that I am very very new like my two-month anniversary is coming up and I'm honestly shocked that it's even been 2 months at all because it feels like 2 minutes and so I've had to learned a lot I mentioned I'm building in Python right now and that has been a big uh like shift because I've never used python before I primarily learned through learning JavaScript and whatnot I went to a coding boot camp and really Focus was very JavaScript heavy that's what I've built web apps with and so when it comes to learning new programs and languages and tools and whatnot especially if you're in a new job or a new boot camp and you're just trying to learn things really quickly I really recommend pair programming that's actually helped me a lot in my learning and I'd like to thank co- screen for sponsoring this video co-c screen is a screen sharing and collaboration tool for like developers built by Developers for developers and so I really love it because they really just hit the nail on the head knowing exactly what developers need most especially with this whole parent teacher conference going on for the last 30,000 years and so it really just makes that process of PA programming a lot easier and a lot smoother I'll link above a video where I share more on pair programming and video how best to yeah go about it so you're getting the most you can out of it co- screen also has low input latency which really allows it to just perform so so fast no matter how many users are on a call 2 3 6 the world is your oyster so knowing that you can work and not experience that lag really just makes a huge huge difference one of the things I really love about Co screen is how easy it was to get it up and running it Tru took no time at all like maybe 3 minutes maybe there are other tools to use for pair programming like vs code and just regular old Zoom sessions however with this it makes the back and for fourth that pair programing often entails a lot more seamless because you can just grab on to a person's screen and type things out or fix typos or direct them and so I really really highly recommend checking out their site checking out the tool itself it's free to use and so go in the link below and check it out and actually if you comment on this video I'm going to select three people total to get a lifetime access to co- screen where you can just use it in all of its glory and unlock all the amazing features it has to offer and so make sure to do that as mentioned I'm going to now do some more app development for that managerial web app I'm building up with you we got no plans we got nothing to do you tell me you love me I go start the coffee Sunday morning easy love with you okay [Music] okay so I used to think I liked front end development more however after spending like a solid 2 months not doing strictly just front end I'm realizing I don't think I do I think I like anything that has to do more with just logic like creating the functions and the functionalities and so maybe so I like the maybe the JavaScript portion of front end development but I also like a lot of backend development and that's what I've realized because here I am trying to style this web page and I can't grab the looking here cuz that's where my monitor is I can't grab what I need to grab like it's not doing what it needs to do it's not giving what's supposed to give it's not understanding the assignment and so speak like I'm so frustrated and that's what is really rough at front end development so a lot of people misinterpret front-end so a lot of people misinterpret front- end development to mean only like oh you're just designing the you know web app the app the page Etc and calling it a DAT but like no there's a lot of logic that goes into it however there's also the designing portion I think it's the designing portion I'm starting to like not so much because at least with the logic there's the constant even if you're not getting it even if you're not producing the output you need to you're still just constantly trying things out and researching and doing all of these things but front end I feel like it's just so slow it's just so slow you feel time so much more cuz here I am trying to just make the width be like the page size and it's just not doing it it's like no 50px is all you get from me and so it just feels so much slower to go through it such a slower process and so yeah that's something I've learned over these last few weeks I don't think I'm as ramped up about front end development as I used to be um yeah yeah okay [Music] anyway early 3:43 p.m. PST I am in LA and yes I shared with my mentor how annoying CSS is I like I said loved front end development love it less so now and so trying to I'm looking I'm looking up I my monitor trying to see how best to go about the rest of my time because at 5:00 I have a new higher bonfire if you saw my Instagram you know that I was sent a package of alcohol um alcohol and a cocktail maker situation like a I don't even what's the word like a DIY cocktail so alcohol and I don't even know was it like tonic water and a juice and garnish ice um so they sent everything you need and so I have the new hire bonfire today at 5:00 so about an hour and 15 minutes and so in that time I'm trying to see what do I want to do and I'm truly thinking while I'm filming what do I want to do so yeah we have a new higher bonfire going on in about 1 and 1 half minutes I have a wine glass because I haven't really done enough apartment Furnishing to now get to the cocktail uh glass part of things so we'll be using this not really sure what proportions to use these ingredients with on what yeah uh so we will try our best but other than that we're at the end end of my day so thank you all for watching and don't forget to leave your comments below"}
