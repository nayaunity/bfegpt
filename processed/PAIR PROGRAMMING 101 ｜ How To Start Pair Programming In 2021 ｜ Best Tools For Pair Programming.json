i provide content for new and aspiring software engineers and today we are talking about pair programming and why you need to start doing it yesterday yeah yeah you're you're late i'll first like to thank postscreen for sponsoring this video co-screen is amazing collaboration and screen sharing tool and i know a lot of people kind of cringe at the thought of pair programming but code screen really makes it this fun enjoyable experience that you can't wait to have and so before we talk more about that first let's go into what is pair programming so pair programming you know the name itself is quite self-explanatory it is programming in a pair or in some type of group ideally you team up with one other person and you all decide who will be the driver who will be the navigator the driver is the person who really actually types and codes things out while the navigator kind of guides that driver if you're thinking about a car the driver is you know the person behind the wheel but the navigator is the person with the map making sure we're going the right place and we're not missing anything i didn't miss that turn over there that's really the dynamics of pair programming if you are less skilled i always recommend kind of counter intuitively to be the driver yeah to be the person coding because that way let's say you are practicing javascript for the first time and you are kind of still iffy on if statements and so you want to have that practice actually coding things out and that way the navigator can be the person guiding you and if they're the person more skilled then their skill sets are heightened by having to now explain things to you and so i feel doing it this way honestly gives you the best results for both people because think about it if you are the person more skilled and you're the driver now the second person kind of is just sitting there because the driver knows all there is to know well quon quote there really is never all there is no anyway so the driver knows all this much and they're coating things out totally forgetting that you're even in the passenger seat trying to make sure that they're going the right way but you know they're going 90 miles an hour on the highway so you can't even figure out on the map where you're supposed to be and so i feel like doing it the opposite way having the person less skilled or less comfortable with what you're currently working on being the driver really just benefits everybody all around and there are just so many benefits when it comes to pair programming one knowledge sharing i've talked about peer programming a bit in the past saying how it's a great way to figure out different solutions even for problems and concepts that you think you have down now you see a different way you could have coded out this if statement you see that you can actually use a ternary operator like what i didn't know this is the thing well now because you pair programmed this person said oh actually we can just use this with the one liner ternary and it's like oh wow i learned something new it's also great for getting through roadblocks much quicker because yeah now you have two eyes on one project even if the other person doesn't even know how to solve a certain problem just by having these two heads two sets of eyes looking at something working something out together oh my goodness it can speed up the development process like crazy and another reason to really take pair programming seriously and i'm speaking to y'all who are trying to get into this field for self teaching or are going through coding boot camp y'all you will be pair programming on the job yes take it from me i just started my job about a month ago and i have already had multiple pair programming sessions and so it is so important to already feel comfortable with the act itself when i used it in my job it was for a different developer guiding me through this project i was put on because it's so hard when you i i'm grateful i'm very grateful to be in this field and to be where i am but y'all it is difficult entering a new team and you are now on projects that have been there been there long before you even were a thought and so now you have to figure out okay what is this code doing what are the functions being used what is the standard of coding it's a lot rather than going through a coding bootcamp for self-teaching you kind of are building these projects from ground zero you know what i mean you're building these apps building these projects from ground to zero and so you are there throughout the entire process but when you're on a team and you get on a team for the first time you are starting from the top of the mountain and you don't know how you got that you just got dropped to the top and i was like okay climb and so it gets difficult and so that's where pair programming at work really takes place for me at least is when it's like okay here is how we are setting up the stage for what you're going to be working on let's pair program for the next hour so you get comfortable with our systems with this new language you're learning and with simply how we code that's repair programming comes in getting you more comfortable with coding on this team and so that's why i had done it actually yesterday and about two weeks ago and so it's important that you already feel comfortable doing it you want to have that practice of turning what another person is saying to you into code and being comfortable with that back and forth and then also flipping it of testing your own knowledge by being the navigator to someone else because y'all i'm sure we all know one of the best ways to learn is to teach it is to teach and it's a great way to see where you're at with something do you really understand it because if you don't really understand it you'll see it when you try to explain it to another person and so it's a great way to just increase your knowledge so so much and so let's go into tools so the very first tool i'm going to be talking about and the one i'm most excited to talk about is coast green coast korea is a collaborative screen sharing and video chat tool it's amazing for pair programming and also group programming sessions because you all can not only share your screen that's like not even the fun part not only share your screen but now that this person has shared their screen you can grab onto their screen you can type into their screen if somebody else pulls up a browser and shares that browser now i can go into the browser and be like actually let's go to github instead and type that in and it's on their browser but here i am manipulating it and so that's why it's so amazing for pair programming because you have vs code up you have your driver navigator so your driver is coding things out you're the navigator you're in charge of scoping out the scene making sure all's good other typos are their broken statements and if you spot those let's say you spot a typo like nothing crazy that you really need to alert your driver about so you just go in and fix the typo for them seamlessly they may not even see it they may not even realize you did it and what's amazing is your system does not feel slow at all while it's running you don't feel any type of lag and everything is still crystal clear and sharp and it is there's no difference it's as if they're there with you coding this problem out helping you learn and develop your skill sets and honestly it's just a very fun tool to use i've used it and i love it i now i kind of just find any excuse to use it like okay well i'm about to watch netflix does someone want to hop on code screen with me and like now i just use it for everything it's just so fun and it takes that angst away from video calls and pair programming because i think all of us with 2020 and now 2021 and who knows how many more 20 20 somethings we are feeling that zoom fatigue i'm not going to speak for you but me i am feeling that zoom fatigue i'm like okay y'all i am in a video chat it seems like every other 30 minutes like i can't do this anymore like can we just not and so this is great because it's not focused on the video chat part of things really there's just the little bubbles on the side of okay this person is here they are active in the session and so it just makes that work session that much more enjoyable along with post screens that's tool number one there are also other tools such as vs code live share fies go live share is great because you can access it via vs code you just download the extension and there you go and so it's also great for pair programming because you get to collaborate with one another being able to see the exact screen and files and terminals that people are working with but the only thing with vs code is you still need to have some kind of other video session up like zoom or microsoft teams or any of the sorts you still need that video tool up to seamlessly talk and see and chat with one another they do have a chat tool but it's not fun having to stop your code to then go into the chat and then see the response from the chat and then go back to your code i'm a person who i'm over here talking it out and coding simultaneously so i don't really like that break in my operational flow and lastly you can do the simple zoom session you can do just the zoom session you share your screen and you have that driver navigator relationship of okay this person is going to be coding it out the other person is going to be talking to them the only thing is if you want to switch at any point who's the driver who's the navigator or let's say you see a typo that the other person doesn't see kind of all operations need to seize and you have to address those things and so let's say you see a typo then it's like tom tom can you hear me am i oh shoot i'm muted tom you have a typo and then they have to go back up into their typo fix it and then continue and so it's less of a seamless experience and if you ever want to switch who's the driver and who's the navigator that also sees this operation for a second because now the original driver needs to stop sharing their screen the new driver needs to start sharing their screen and it's a more manual switch that needs to happen you actually have to get out of the car switch seats and sit down but it too can get the job done and so that's really why i love code screen the first time i used it it took no time at all it took figuring out and that's another thing with vs code it does take some figuring out there are multiple setup steps that you need to really figure out before you can really dive in but this once you get it installed you get into the session and boom you're off to the races like y'all i really love this tool i really love this tool like i said i use any excuse to start using and it's the first time you use it you'll see you'll get very impressed you'll be like oh wow i can just i can just go into here and just copy and paste something that's on your screen and copy it onto my screen or fix your typo and you don't even see any difference in again lag time or any operational difficulties it's it's a great experience and what's great is you can use code screen for free there is a bit of a limitation on how many sessions you can have per month is about 10 sessions a month for the free plan however if you comment down below i will be choosing three people to get a lifetime membership with co-screen so now that cap on sessions you can do per month it is gone and so make sure you leave a comment below and lastly i'm going to talk about where to get a pair programming partner this is something i find to be very important especially if you are self teaching or going to according boot camp and in general not in an institution like a college or something where you have you know your dorm mates and your classmates and all of this just available to you if you are going through coding boot camp you are actually in a pretty good place i do highly recommend just hitting up the chat and saying yo who has one hour i would love to pair programs this is something that i did i went to flat art school for anyone who doesn't know but i went to planner school last year and i would do this and other people would do this too of okay who wants to pay a program for the next 30 minutes i am working on this project i'd love to pair program now where it gets tricky is if you are self-teaching if you are self-teaching join some type of group like a facebook group a slack channel a linkedin group join some type of group that's focused on programming especially programming either as a beginner or self-teaching and so join something that speaks to you and be active on those channels make relationships and say hey i would love to have a pair programming session with somebody you don't need to have a whole project set up you can even just do a leak code session with someone like i'm going to be going over five problems on late code i would love to pair program with someone as we solve these problems together so go past just using your ide to problem solve because being a software engineer is just so much more than that it's about true meaningful collaboration and so that's what you should practice while on your journey to become such and so i love code screen because it does such an amazing job at helping you do that i understand that pair programming can sometimes be this thing of like oh oh no and there can be so much hesitation so little buy-in especially with beginners you feel like you're not there yet or you just are you just feel asked about it either because you feel like it's too advanced for you or you're afraid of having someone watch your code because you're like what if they say i'm not good enough or what if they show me all these problems and all of these things y'all seriously if for no other reason do it because on the job it is going to be something that you want to feel comfortable with already so make sure you be a download of that knowledge sharing and just become a better developer in general so thank you all so much for watching don't forget to leave that comment below and i'll talk to you later bye"}
