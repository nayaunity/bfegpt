engineer and I provide content for new and aspiring software engineers and today I am on a mission the job market for the last year and a half has not been it the tech job market specifically I'm sure other job markets do but I don't know nothing about that I got my first sixf figure software engineering role after going to a boot camp and apply Ling like crazy and doing everything I could to get a job which included writing articles on medium and networking and posting on LinkedIn and all of that right however the landscape is so different I did that all back in 2020 and now 4 years later I don't know if I could have done the same and gotten a job as quickly as I did and I've gotten so many questions about what my advice for going through the 2024 Tech job market would be and I don't want to give the same advice because I don't know I no longer know what it's going to take because again it's been so long so I'm going to do something okay this is day Zero I'm going to do four different things and whichever one works best at the end of 30 days and 60 days I will tell y'all but I'm also going to bring y'all along this journey with me okay the first thing I'm going to do is do the things that I did do back in 2020 that means writing on LinkedIn at least weekly a new project that I've built writing on medium at least weekly something Tech related something insightful something to teach somebody Etc every time I see a job that I like and want to apply to finding someone who works at the company and reaching out to them and hoping for that I can get a 15 minute chat or conversation with them updating my GitHub so that it looks so crisp so clean so fo and having it act as my portfolio because fun fact I actually don't have a portfolio it just I don't know I just never wanted to do it just seems like so much work when I could just use GitHub if I use it properly I could just use GitHub but really refurbishing it okay those are the main things I'm going to focus on but I'm also going to provide a list of literally all the things that I did back in 2020 to get a job as fast as I did and Implement that into my routine so that'll be number one for getting a job so that's the first thing right that I'm going to focus on now the next thing is going to be doing that but also focusing on the new ways of the market which very much is AI I want to create some AI projects and talk about AI more and see if that assists in getting me a job the first approach is doing all things I did in 2020 the second step is tweaking it so that it is AI focused so that it is updated for the Times number three I'm going to see how well freelancing works for me I love live building mobile apps I've built a lot within the last year I've posted about some of make sure you follow me on Tik Tok and Instagram and not only here seeing how freelancing goes and the reason I say freelancing is because when you are facing and by you I mean me are facing a really terrible Market it's important to now do things differently and maybe give the market time to breathe but in that time you need ways to sustain yourself and to earn an income and so freelancing is a great way to do that I'll use up work and Fiverr to get freelancing gigs I do obviously also have my own social media following which people can reach me to get freelancing roles but for the sake of this challenge I'm not going to include my social presence as part of this experiment it will all be focused on upwork and fiber but if you do want to have me build an app for you let me know and I would love to do that but yes it just when we in the videos I share about how this is all going I just won't include the social media ones because it takes a while to build a social media presence and if you need a job you kind of need one now so let's see what we can do right now to earn extra income so that's experiment 3 and finally four is seeing if I can simply earn an income by releasing my own things by releasing an app onto the App Store and seeing what attaction that gives me okay I feel like under the umbrella of possibilities for work and specifically work as a tech professional that really covers it all we have corporate we have freelancing and we have entrepreneurship which freelancing falls into that a little bit but like I hope y'all can also see the difference that I'm making if y'all want to know what I'm doing every single week so that you can see if you have any success with it as well don't worry because I'm going to post about it every single week the very first thing I'm going to do is create profiles on upwork and Fiverr and update my resume now that seems simple right but no the updating the resume one is very important to me because I'm going to do it extremely strategically and this is how I as a person in Tech wear and have worn many hats I am a software engineer but I'm also a front-end developer but I'm also a mobile developer but I'm also a ux UI developer and so because of this there are different resum\u00e9s I can create for each role however when looking at Job boards the role usually will say one of the four it won't say all of these things and so you want to make sure you're optimizing your resume for the specific title of the role so what I'm going to do is search software engineer and the first 10 items that pop up I'm going to populate it into chat GPT the description of the role along with the qualifications and preferred skills populate it into chat jpt and see what it fits out for what similarities between all of those 10 postings exist I'm going to then use those similarities to populate my resume and make the software engineering resume then I'm going to make the ux engineer resume so those two are the very first things I'm going to do to make sure that this goes swimmingly and as efficiently as possible this is day Zero if you have any recommendations or anything you want me to test out please let me know for example let's say you want me to test out conferences and networking at conferences put that in the comments below and I will let you know if I can or cannot add that into my experiment I'm going to split the experiment up into two sessions first 30 days and then the next 30 days in the first 30 days I'm going to focus on all just going ham and at day 30 I'm going to share with y'all any and all progress what interviews if any that I've gotten what income if any that I've gotten Etc and how I'm going to change for the next 30 days and then we're going to do it all over again make sure you like And subscribe and tune in every week so that you know exactly how this is going okay so yeah wish me luck y'all and again please put in the comments below what things you'd like me to try out and test out and what things You' just like to see during this time okay I'll talk to you soon bye"}
