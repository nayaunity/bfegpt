and this person got it this was for the Microsoft leap apprenticeship they got the apprenticeship after doing these things hello everybody my name is Nia and I'm the black female engineer I provide content for you and aspiring software engineers and today we are going to talk about everything you need to get in order to actually have a shot at the amazing apprenticeship programs coming up this year apprenticeship programs are one of the best ways to get your foot in the door and not only just foot but like your whole body in the door because a lot of the time after you get the apprenticeship program you are basically on track to being a full-time employee really great apprenti programs include Pinterest Airbnb which is actually open now Google Microsoft LinkedIn Shopify there's so many and I just see so many people not even getting a shot because they don't know how to actually put their best foot forward so not anymore we're going to fix that right now I've added open and upcoming apprenticeships in the description box below so make sure you check those out when it comes to putting your best foot forward for these programs we're going to focus on three main things your resume your GitHub and your LinkedIn I highly encourage you to optimize these three things and to not really consider yourself done or set up well to be honest if you haven't done this so let's start with your resume now with these programs the understanding typically is that the applicant does not have any previous Tech experience and that is the want they want people who are not developers who do not have a computer science degree already they want people transitioning into this field so do not stress about oh my goodness I don't have any relevant experience to put what you do need to do is focus on these two main parts your professional experience in general and your projects starting with your professional experience we need to show that we are a fantastic candidate based on the transferable skills we bring from our previous experience what are transferable skills transferable skills are skills that we acquired from a different industry from a different field but are extremely relevant and important to the ultimate job we want a job in Tech a job as a software engineer as a data engineer Etc top transferable skills for Tech include being detail oriented high levels of communication skills being able to see a problem and enact tangible real solutions to solve that that problem and so think back to your previous experience and say okay in what ways did I exhibit skills that this job calls for before becoming a software engineer I had jobs in accounting and finance and so what I had put in my resume was investigate leading causes of profit or loss in the stock market that day based on these three factors I definitely sprued it up but do we see how that one line sh know like oh okay so she she can look at data and come to a conclusion so what I suggest doing is looking up top transferable skills for Blink the job that you want and see that list and see okay how can I use my previous experience as proof of me acquiring and using those skills another thing you're going to want to do in the professional experience part of your resume is list off off within the first eight words some type of metric the format you want to follow is the impact you had by way of some Metric and then how you did that thing something I could say for my finance job is reduced data processing time by 20% by utilizing python to analyze these three main points of of data I don't even think I used python I think I used starts with the V the thing I used to speed up the whole data process we want to hit them immediately with the impact we had and then how we did it don't just simply say what your job was because like we can just get that from the job description don't tell me what you did please tell me the impact you had so that's the professional section of our resume now we have the project section within your project section you're going to put two projects and list them off pretty similarly to how you would list off a job I'm going to add in an example for you to follow along with list off the project name the tech you used and then two to three bullet points on the problem that project solves and key metrics again like our professional experience a project I had when I was first learning to code was basically Al in all recipes you know a person could go and search the recipe they want let's say for lamb and then all of these different recipes would come up and I would provide a shopping list for them and all of this and so if I listed that within my resume I would have the project name which was mins the technology I used which was Vanilla JavaScript and Ruby on Rails and then two to three bullet points starting off with enhanced users Meal Time prep by providing thousands of dinner options based on their preferences and then follow that up with metrics so a metric I had was something like queried 5,000 plus recipes from the I think it was called Edom from the Edom or edamame API in order to provide users with a wide array of recipes and just many options so say the problem you're SOL in and then provide metrics provide data provide anything that is a number to show okay we did this and I did that and I pulled from here because will truly add so much more impact with what you're saying it'll also provide proof to the person looking at your resume that okay she actually did something here she's not just making something up she's being specific I can trust in what she is claiming she did check the description box all also for some resum\u00e9 templates and examples now let's talk about our GitHub our GitHub is the portfolio for our coding experience you're not required to have a ton you're not required to have built some AI super computer or anything but you typically are required or I guess not required because do what you want but the people who are going to receive call backs are the people who truly show an interest in this new career and how do you show an interest by building projects so this is how we set up our GitHub to act like a really fantastic project for our applications and that way we also don't have to mess around with creating a whole portfolio website or anything like that because secret I have never had a portfolio website I find them personally to be a waste of time when GitHub is right there so what you're going to do first first off is make sure the projects you want to showcase pick between two and five aim for three make sure those projects have a thorough readme and a thorough read me is a readme with the following section an intro section sharing what the project is what it's about what challenges it solves Technologies use a walkthrough video code Snippets challenges faced key features in what is next for your app even if you never want to touch it again what would be the logical next step for it then also at the very bottom just add in ways to contact you ideally your LinkedIn URL now let me talk about the walkthrough video very quickly this is very important because a lot of times the person reviewing your application isn't extremely technical it is a recruiter or typical regular recruiter for the job and so they may not be able to re read the code Snippets but they can look at a video and see what your code turned into and so what you want to do is simply create a screen recording of you using your project whether it's a web app a mobile app a game whatever it it may be create a screen recording and then upload that screen recording to YouTube but don't worry no one you don't want to see it will see it because you're going to publish it under unlisted unlisted simply means that the only people who can see this video see that this video even exists are people who have the URL so you're going to mark it as unlisted and take that URL and add it into your GitHub you don't have to show your face you don't have to talk at all just use the app the way a user would use the app and also make sure you're including key features that you would want want to present now what you want to do is Mark those two to five projects that you have with the thorough readmes make sure you mark those in your GitHub profile as featured projects this makes it so that once a person lands on your profile they see your projects front and center they don't have to go digging for anything it's very clear and that's what they will gravitate towards now we have our readme put together we have the project we've selected we need to make our GitHub profile read as a portfolio and as an additional look into who we are as a developer this is the platform I love for very quickly and easily making your GitHub from something that's just super Bland and kind of just like nothing to something very very informative and quite impressive now on your profile you'll have the Technologies you're proficient in your key projects intros about you it's so much more informative and also informs the companies you're applying to like oh no I'm serious like no me here oh oh you have a serious person on your hands and a very interested person at your hands so beep beep like call me back so amazing our GitHub looks now let's talk about our LinkedIn our resume expresses our experience our GitHub expresses our portfolio our projects our LinkedIn expresses how we show up professionally so we need to make sure that headshot is updated it is crisp it is clear every single head shot I've ever had on my LinkedIn has been from a selfie the one I have right now I was in my bedroom I was against the wall and I went click and that was all that is all it took I went into canva added a pretty little ring around my frame and now that is my LinkedIn profile and I a pretty good one if you ask me next your headline take out the word aspiring from your headline right now I don't want to see a SP in nothing on your headline it needs to say software engineer data engineer cyber security analyst whatever again the roles you're applying for are it needs to say that you are that would you hire an aspiring Chef an aspiring doctor right so please remove the word aspiring or training or whatever from your headline and claim what you are a software engineer because that's what's great about tech is we don't need to have a job to be that thing just like how with a chef you don't need to be actively working to claim that you are a chef because that is what you are in your heart and soul so show people that I am a software engineer I'm a developer that that's all there is no questions ifs ands or butts about it in your about section add in just some info about yourself what industry were you in before and what motivated you to pursue this new career it doesn't have to be anything crazy 3 to six sentences have chat PT help you and we're all good now go down to your experience section and make sure it perfectly matches your resume when I say perfectly matches I mean it has the exact same titles that you put in your resume it has the exact same bullet points you put in your resume even for your project don't think oh it's the project I don't need bullet points yes you do yes you do yep so go in in your resume the resume Wiis proed up and made beautiful and amazing and crisp and clean copy it and add it straight onto your LinkedIn and now boom we have your professional experience and projects which for me I had put projects under professional experience because what about it like you're not going to tell me that this isn't technically professional experience so I put my project in my professional experience and listed the bullet points off just like I had done and boom I had a beautifully laid out Link in and then make sure under your skills you list all the different skills and Tech your profession in JavaScript Ruby iOS HTML CSS all of it bootstrap all of it and once we have those three things we are set up for a very successful application process and just apprenticeship season and if you do not believe me look at this comment I got where I said every single thing I said there but honestly I was even less detailed because you know it's short form so what are you going to do we're on YouTube so we have a little bit more time together and this person got it this was for the Microsoft leap apprenticeship they got the apprenticeship after doing these things okay y'all so please save yourself
