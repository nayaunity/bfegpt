provide content for you and aspiring software engineers and today we're going to talk about how I build my apps in seven days yeah you've heard that right I can go from this to this in just one week whenever I have a new app idea I can't sit on it for long because then I just demotivate myself and also tell myself all the reasons why it's not a good idea and I can't have that because I'm trying to build something here and even if you're not trying to create something for the outside world to see building apps is a great way to get more experience build up your portfolio and ultimately show other people jobs Etc that you know what you're doing that they should hire you so how can we do so in a way that doesn't take up all of our time number one the very first thing I do when I have a new app idea and decide you know what I have seven days to build this out is decide what my MVP is MVP stands for a minimally viable product and it's basically what is the least functionality this app needs to have so that it is technically a full app fully working and the concept is there for example I recently built out a dating app where people would get to rate their dates I wanted a way to know that the people I'm going on dates with were people who were going to be insanely late going to be respectful all the works and so what was my MVP well it's a dating app so there needed to be some type of matching mechanism number two there needed to be some type of messaging mechanism because how are we going to get from swiping to a date so I needed to create some messaging and then finally there needed to be some way for them people to rate their dates once they went on one so creating a page where people could rank People based on how respectful they were timely they were all the works then boom with those three things I would have my MVP because of who I am as a person I can start getting very distracted with all the other things I want to add into an app for example with a dating app something that would be really cool for me to add is location services making sure that you feel safe and whatnot and you can tag your location so that everyone God forbid you know nothing goes wrong everyone knows where you are so location services every photo and video that you would want included all those different things these are just two examples of how adding features that would make I believe for a better dating app just detracted from the goal of the app itself which was getting to rap people number two I don't do the backend I don't I don't do it I don't do it I don't do it I'm not a backend developer so even though I know how to implement things like authentication allowing people to log in and sign up for your app and creating databases that are good robust and secure and whatnot I don't want to it takes away time from doing things that require actual customization logging in and creating a database is the same thing every single time and so why am I spending time doing something that is pretty standard when I could work on creating something that for me doesn't yet exist is a whole new Innovative idea and is going to be the thing that sets my my app apart so what I do instead is I use Google's Firebase to build out the back end for me this after doing some research is the resource that I found to be the best and easiest to use for me this is not an ad and I know it sounds like one but I really do use Firebase all the time and really really love it by using Firebase I get to create a login and signup screen along with databases lots of databases in a matter of literally moments and because because it is Google I don't have to worry about it not being secure especially if I do end up releasing the app into the public so making sure that my back end is handled by other people I get to focus on the parts of the app that actually get me excited using the dating app as an example again I use Google's Firebase to allow users to sign up and log in have the app track their swipes their right and left swipes and who are matches for them I also get to implement messaging within the app which was really cool cuz I had never had an app with real time messaging before so that was really awesome and pretty simple to learn as well and yeah being able to have a fully functioning app because the back end is being handled was really phenomenal so yes I really recommend it and if anyone from Google is watching this can you please sponsor me because I love y'all and I promise I'll do right by all number three a little controversial maybe but like listen to me hear the words I'm saying okay please I copy like a lot so so hold up first let's understand that the things I'm copying either one my app is not going to be uh brought to the public and so it's okay that I'm copying because I'm doing doing it all for my own learning and just proving to myself that I can build this thing so that's number one why is Okay number two it'll be okay even if I release it to the public if I make sure I'm not copying something proprietary so for example with that dating app users swipe to get a match well the swiping feature is something that is proprietary and trademarked to Tinder so if I actually wanted to release this app I could not do that I could not do that at all swiping to create a match is trademarked so I would need to create a whole another mechanism to allow users to look through their users say who they like don't like and then create a match but because I'm not releasing this app to the public it is okay for me to have some swiping and learn through that process you know copying also comes in handy for me because I am not good at creating UI and it's really funny to say that because I really do like the UI of the things I have created oh my God what is that however it takes a lot of research for me and I guess for actual UI ux developers that this is what they do too but it takes a lot of research for me to get to a UI that I like because I can't just create it for my own mind I cannot just think to myself like oh this is how I want a login screen to look or this is how I want the homepage to look I cannot I can my my mind goes blank instead I need to look for inspiration elsewhere and then attempt to replicate it when I was building mostly web apps I would go to wix.com and look through all their different templates and see which pages I liked and which pages I wanted to recreate onto my own web app now that I'm building mobile apps primarily I think about what genre the app that I'm creating lies in for example dating or Fitness or social media so now that I have the genre let me download all of those different apps in the same genre and look at how they organize their things how they put different icons and displays and whatnot so that is how I copy to make sure that I am not spending days on days wondering how I want my app to look like and there we have it y'all how I create apps in seven days this is for web apps mobile apps Etc these TPS are the same for me and yeah I hope that's very helpful for y'all please let me know what y'all are creating if you know it's not meant for the public because I don't want your ideas to get snatched out here but let me know what you're creating I would love to hear what's in your portfolio projects and whatnot and what other videos you'd like to see from me so no I'll talk to you later bye"}
