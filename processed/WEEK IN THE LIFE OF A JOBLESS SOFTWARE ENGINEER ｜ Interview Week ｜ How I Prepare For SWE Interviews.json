{"video_title": "WEEK IN THE LIFE OF A JOBLESS SOFTWARE ENGINEER \uff5c Interview Week \uff5c How I Prepare For SWE Interviews", "transcript": "I just got an email well the interview is not happening okay so my interview is to oh wait no it's not tomorrow it's in two days but I want to really hone down the behavior questions I've spent a lot of time getting to know the company the company values along with um like getting my technical just knowledge really like robust with basically what they work on so I'm going to really work on some behavioral questions right now that tomorrow is just a light touchup and it's not me trying to crank down all the behavioral the day before the interview you know what I mean okay it's Father's Day so my parents came to pick me up and enjoy the day at their house so let's pack up and go okay oh hello did you like some flowers so this is what they make us do on P [Laughter] [Music] I hope everyone had a good Father's Day I had a great one with my family as you saw and now I'm back to work mode my interview is tomorrow I told myself I would do behavioral questions in the first part of the day and then um the later part of the day I would focus more on developing using their products to get more acquainted with the company and their teams this afternoon um soon in a little over an hour I have a quick chat with one of the workers there I prefer to wash my face in the kitchen nowadays my bathroom sink is so low and I just end up just hunching over so much okay for my behavioral questions I've been using the techin handbook. org for prep they have a page named most commonly asked behavioral questions across top tech companies and these are really great questions from the basics of why do you want to work for X company but also questions like what is something you had to persevere at for multiple months and how have you handled criticism of your work and what I have found is if you can Master these questions which is literally 1 through 29 you then have the blueprint for answering all of their behavioral questions they also then break it down per like company so they say Airbnb software engineer behavioral questions Amazon bite dance Dropbox hired and it's all for free it is such an amazing resource that I really hope yall know about it's phenomenal I'm going to start off the conversation just saying yep I have an interview for this this and this and you being a black woman of the company especially at the location that inter for I really wanted to hear about what your experience has been so far in your career that's one and I'll see what questions come to me as she's talking okay so that was pretty good um I was a tiny I was a tiny tiny bit thrown off in the beginning of the call the beginning of the call cuz they're busy and I get it they're busy so I since truly appreciate her putting her time to talk to me um at the same time I think just hearing I think that's what I'm trying to say hearing that busyness coming through the call was scary for me I was like oh okay let me really go through these questions as fast as possible and get everything I can but overall I think that went really well I think that went really well now that that is done that was a big part of today um let me look at my to-do list I want to well I think I should spend a little bit of the day relaxing a tiny bit um but also I think cuz it's 3:13 right now the call lasted just under 11 minutes I think by around 4:35 I'll start developing with their products with the company's products of B to better understand also um their Tech and whatnot it's interview day it is Tuesday June 18th Happy juneth eve y'all and I am excited I'm reminding myself over and over that this is a behavioral interview or like it likely is one because it's literally only 30 minutes long and it's on the phone it's not even a video interview it's l literally on the cell phone she's going to call me and we're going to have a quick little chat and it's going to be amazing last night I ended up not doing any more prep actually I know I said I would check out their developer tools I was just so so tired like not even like sleepy type of tired you know when you're just mentally drained I was just very mentally drained and because I was reminding myself that this is a 30 minute like recruiter screen I was like K like you don't even need to dive into all that just yet like it's okay that time will come you don't need to do it now let's work smarter not harder one thing I was struggling with last night was finding a good answer for the question what is your biggest weakness I think most of us all know that answers don't cut it anymore you know the ones that are like oh I'm just such a perfectionist or like I'm just too much of a team player like I was like no I need a real answer that's simply just not that bad and like I can explain a way type of thing and I was able to think of one and I'm very happy I decided to lean on something I said um two YouTube videos ago in my video how to build apps in seven days or how I build apps in seven days I don't remember I'll put it right here but something I said was it is really ult for me to just conjure up from nowhere from my own mind the specific design of certain things I know how like I want it to look but when it comes to the specific nuances necessary to make that a reality that can be very difficult for me and I said in that video I said how because of that wait wait hold on doing some intricate work here so in my YouTube video I said that because of that I do a lot of research regarding the UI and really honing down how I want it to look through that process and so yeah I decided to use that as what's my biggest weakness and explain it [Music] away I need to find good questions to ask them I was I forgot saving that for today let me update the lighting hold on okay I think okay I think that's better okay I think these are my options for atire I'm feeling a dress I'm leaning more towards these two I'm going to start off with this cuz it's like it's not like a super hot day today but it's like yeah it's kind of cold I'm not going to lie I woke up and went outside it was kind of cold so let me try this first I really like this I've never worn the dress which is why I'm over here like wow I really like it I've never worn it I bought it a couple months ago just off the rack and yeah I think it's cute okay so this is what we're going with today um yeah oh yeah okay my interview is four minutes away and I'm excited I'm excited I'm excited um yeah it's going to be good make sure to be a member of this YouTube channel because then you get to hear the entire interview with some like alak the company and whatnot but yes you'll get to hear all of it let me have my resume in front of me so I can very easily refer back to it and like I said it's a phone call but I wanted to just make sure I looked good so I felt good felt confident and that just exuded through every sweat gland okay wish me luck just seconds away we are just seconds away should get a call any moment now okay now it's been 2 minutes it is 1:32 let me draft an email that I might send to her at 135 I'll send it to her it's 133 now okay I drafted the email hi I'm very excited to speak with you about the blanket rooll at blank I believe our

this time that I can't speak to her because she has to Res scheduled for Friday because her whole week is booked with interviews she's doing interviews all this week right I could end up having less time to prepare for the second interview trying to like catch up with everyone like because of that I think I need to start preparing for like the technical nap Agreed 100% I mean I would a th% agree with that I swear if I get to Friday and they're like sorry we hired someone I'm gonna I'm gonna jump off I'm I'm gonna be done okay Universe what is meant for me will be for me okay I'll say can you critique this from me no worries exclamation point I'm really interested in this role period if you do end up having time before Friday please let me know exclamation point I'm available at any time this week period can we change the second period to a [Music] semic okay it is now 2:43 p.m. and I have moved on to learning more about recursion I ended last night trying to practice some recursion problems however I kind of don't really know much about it other than the general concept and so decided today this afternoon to really focus in on building that knowledge and I'm actually really happy with myself because I can already see myself improving that's like the best feeling to me like something that like you couldn't even wrap your head around now you can wrap your hand and also kind of like maneuver a little bit um I actually bought a course yesterday um what what was the course the course is Master the coding interview by Andre Nei on udemy I appreciate what the course is trying to do however I think I just am a person who learns best and fastest with just handson problem solving and I feel like the course is just like too base level for the type of quick learning for a tech interview that I'm trying to do like they cover everything from beginner data structures and explaining Big O and whatnot all the way down to the more complex stuff and I skipped over the beginner um items like a raise to get to like linked list and I feel like everything was just so surface level I don't really like that and that's really how I spent most of my morning and so with the afternoon I was like you know what let me go back to just doing what I was doing last night which is getting that hands- on practice I really hope that by the end of today I can feel more confident in recursion and can move on to I'm thinking trees tomorrow but also guess what my interview is tomorrow the interview that was supposed to be yesterday yeah it is tomorrow morning and so I'm going to try to just end this this as soon in the evening as possible I'm thinking like 6:00 p.m. I can finish 600 p.m. 7:00 p.m. that way I can get the rest I need to wake up and have a really good interview so yeah I'm glad I can finally fingers crossed film that for y'all tomorrow and tell y'all how that goes because remember I'm doing these technical interview prep right now for an interview that I don't even have yet I haven't even secured yet because I haven't even gone through the first interview the the round one screening call so yes fingers crossed um I hope you all had a really good juneth like I hope you got to love on yourself love on your community and just yeah hopefully you also got the day off yeah it's a Federal holiday so I hope you got the day off so no this is my day it's interview day it is 8:17 in the morning Thursday morning and I have well no not 8:17 I just looked at my phone it's 8:19 so I have about 10 11 minutes before my interview so no I'm going to set

absolutely okay that was super simple I didn't have to do it I have a second interview it looks like yeah okay perfect okay taking out the garage to go to work no the interview went really well it was pretty basic um it's like cuz it was just 30 minutes on the phone with the recruiter so like I I felt like it would be yes so I felt like it would be pretty chill just kind of like checking like my qualifications and if I'm a good fit you know what I mean and yeah no that's exactly what it was was and by the end of the interview she said she would move me to the next round um which is a 1-hour technical interview and like"}
