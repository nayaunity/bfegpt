engineer i provide content for new and aspiring software engineers and today we're doing a little unboxing so as i revealed i work for dreamworks animations and so they sent me a couple of packages expecting some to be functional like computers and whatnot but i think i get some swag also which would be nice because i like free things so so yeah i just wanted to give you all an inside look of if you are about to start your first career or your first job in the tech field what you may be able to expect of your new job what can be sent to you and so yeah i i have three i keep looking over here because i have three boxes one's like this big and i couldn't take i can't take this off i still yeah please ignore this i just got back from lollapalooza in chicago and i still don't have like knives or anything or scissors or anything in this apartment and so i haven't been able to take this off yet because i moved in and then two days later went to chicago so literally i have nothing to do more shopping today so you won't see it in you know future videos god forbid a year from now you're still seeing this in videos but i have a small box kind of like that then i have like a box like twice that size and i have a pretty huge box over here and so we'll just go smallest to largest so let's see here so this is the first box i haven't opened anything uh i'm using my keys to open because again i don't have anything in this apartment i don't have a knife i don't have a letter opener [Music] oh interesting it's a track pad i don't know let me try to focus in on this yeah it's a track pad not gonna lie to you i have never used one before magic trackpad two i don't know what generation i don't know if that's the most recent generation or if that's like one or two behind but i think it'll do the job i've never used one i imagine it'll be a nice thing to use especially with bigger screens and everything but okay okay okay so now the second box which is yeah bigger than that let's see oh wow it's a whole magic keyboard i believe all the tech and materials i'll be getting are from apple but yeah it's the magic keyboard again i imagine it is the latest one like 2021 2020 2. um i cannot tell but that's what i imagine so i'll open that soon as well and now we have a humongous i can't even i can't even stand it up it's huge so i i'm now i'm wondering if it's going to be a desktop like a hole or a laptop because i was expecting a laptop like a macbook oh it is a backpack it is a backpack full oh wow it's a backpack full of like everything else so yeah it says this is the backpack oh and there's my picture oh that's cool oh that's cute that's cute but yeah it says comcast on it because dreamworks i don't know who knows those dreamworks is under the umbrella of nbcuniversal who is under the umbrella of comcast so yes dreamworks is under the umbrella of comcast and so there's the backpack but this tough image oh wow this is huge so i have the macbook pro in here um the 16 inch it's the 16 inch it's a 60 inch macbook pro in space gray 16 gigabyte okay i like this it's heavy like wow it is heavy so i'm going to open that soon but i also have an iphone and this is the iphone 11 in black 128 gigabytes i think the phone i'm using like the phone i have is a 10 x like a 10x s so yeah this is the next generation of i don't know what generation iphone is on right now but yeah this is cool like it's in black my favorite color actually not really my favorite color is more of a powder pink even though i don't really show it um we have a multimedia hub from belkin let me make sure you can see it but no this looks great because it looks like you can connect a whole lot in here so that'll be perfect then we have using my keys so i have a set of air pods then i have an otterbox phone case which is really nice because i be dropping then what is this oh i thought this was um like a portable charger it's just a charger so perfect so we have another charger from wall port and that is it for this box there's some more in here though we're almost done though we have a shirt so it says comcast nbc universal core tech so that's really very exciting i like the color i like the color a ton we have that's funny some coffee and tea i think it goes like this is what would be in their office and i'm primarily from what i believe going to be working from home so i think they're like here girl we got you um we have a ticket i don't know where to um like comcast also owns universal studios so i know we get tickets free tickets to that but i don't imagine that this is the ticket to enter i may be wrong i may be wrong but i don't imagine i think this is more of a cute momento or maybe redeemable for like for the office or something and we have a folder this is it let me really look before i get in trouble for not taking everything yeah looks like we're good enough do we have a folder oh i don't think anything isn't oh okay so it has a little welcome letter in the folder we're excited for you to kick off let's talk about orientation so by the time you watch this video orientation would have been the previous week for me but as i'm sitting here right now orientation is tomorrow starts tomorrow for the entire week so they're just talking about the agenda and powering my laptop and all that so i will read it in full detail when i am not looking at a camera as much as i love y'all i can't read under pressure like that y'all um oh oh wait we also got some snacks we also got some snacks yes i think they're trying to just have like a little like things that would be in the office for me you know but it's like oh it's not she's on the office so let's just ship it to her so that's so nice oh is there more but yeah but i'm really happy with all this i'm excited to set all of this up and do a little desk setup for y'all i hope this shed some light onto what you can expect to receive from your welcome package if you just charge
