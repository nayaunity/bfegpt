{"video_title": "DAYS ITL OF A JOBLESS SOFTWARE ENGINEER \uff5c Entry Level Software Engineer Interview", "transcript": "okay I have exactly 1 hour to do as much studying as I can right now because I am going to my sister's baby welcome it was supposed to be a baby shower actually okay so I just completed shortest bridge on lead code I this is probably one of my like more difficult ones the fact that I can complete it and it handles topics like DFS depth first search and BFS breadth first search all inone problem is astounding to me that I can now solve such a problem it's been literally about 8 days of me staying on e code for 6 to 10 hours every single day and this was one of the ones that was on an orange and now it's on a green and so I have how many problems I have one I have 10 problems that I really want to cram crank and into my head before Monday these are 20 problems of company specific lead code problems and 10 of them I feel I have down and good the other 10 I need some more practice with so I need to get dressing ready for the baby shower I'm going to head over and pray I can get back here by like 6:00 so I can do 4 hours of studying and 4 hours of studying should get me through all 10 of these and then tomorrow then it's just last finishing steps I was in charge of creating a game for the baby welcome and the stuff got delivered so let me show you so the theme is like bees and like honey and honeycomb so I decided to create a game called sweet as honey which is basically a taste testing game I got different types of Honey not really types of honey but I guess like flavors of honey and I'm going to put them all in different containers for people to taste and they're going to put in their guesses for what flavor the honey is so this is cinnamon whipped honey this is hot honey oops it's extra hot that is a mistake I did not mean it to be extra hot Orange Blossom honey and based on who guesses the most amount they get a prize which is this BS bees cute little set the only thing is babies can't eat honey or else like they so I'm going to just let everyone know like don't give the baby Hy like it was going to feed the baby honey but I'll put a sign that's like this is for adult SL non bab consumption only I was going to put them all in these little glass containers but look the way it got delivered so that's upsetting hello [Music] hello hi yes Nia I'm doing very well how are you yes so I started my career at Comcast NBC Universal and my first rotation was at DreamWorks it was a two-year rotational program at DreamWorks I worked primarily as a full stack software engineer and when I came onto the team I was actually the person with the most web development experience so very quickly on I was set to design code and test a web app that would allow for increased um just autonomy to showrunners basically my manager had to constantly keep tabs of what storage looked like on the different shows but now at this web app the goal was for them to monitor that themselves and my manager and the rest of my team getting that time back so that was my first year lots of learning done there and then my second year I worked as an iOS engineer and that team was I was exfinity specifically um where NBC Universal was the first year and there I definitely learned very quickly um how to learn even more rapidly than I had had practice before because I for the first time was working with mobile apps so that was a huge learning experience but I felt in love with the development of mobile apps and so once that was done I definitely continued on um and trying to learn as much as I can on the Swift side building mobile apps and whatnot and overall that I feel like is very interesting because being at dreamers and working with imaginations and creativity I found myself very um excited to apply to this role given that it's all about creativity and enhancing Communication in that way yeah I would say the example that pops up um pops out at me the most is when I identified basically a an accessibility Gap Within in xin's um products I very um non-intentionally was in the meeting with someone who was going over their assets and products and I just brought up um like hey I feel like the colors specifically being used aren't very accessible and after saying that I actually took on to review a bunch of the company's assets looking at okay if a user needed to navigate solely from the key keyboard would they be able to do so if a user didn't have access to viewing the image in front of the screen how does the alt text read and things like that and so by being able to identify this I was actually then put on a project that created a basically a whole overhaul of the company's um assets and looking at how can we as a company do better what development um needs to be done so that all images are taken care of of and keyboard navigation and even things like graphic design and overall I was able to show that this was a good investment because over 10% of the United States population has some sort of accessibility difficulty and Comcast being a fortune 20 company at least at the time they serve millions of consumers and so 10% is not a small Gap at all and they understood this and I was able to make that difference by then being able to provide a step-by-step guideline on how to move forward so that people feel like the product are made for them something that I found very interesting was when decided to overhaul their Android app because they realize that Android users don't feel like is made for them and there's a big difference in um capability between iPhone and Android users so being able to do that for um a big market like that in such a big way was very um powerful empowering for me it was on the web but also it was on the assets that were also used on mobile for example the digital assets the images the text um colors things like that were being used on both it was I don't have a true number of how many assets what I can say it was multi-level and multi-tiered for example Not only would the images not be accessible but also the um video assets didn't have proper um like close captioning and also keyboard um navigation was not available and so it honestly was at every a gap was identified yes so so for example if a person was on some page and they tried to start navigating using either tab or space bar or enter the keyboard the page I remember at one point was able to navigate through the main menu bar and then jumped to the middle of the page and then jumped back yes and so in order to um provide a solution for this one of the best ways I saw was by providing div classes and IDs to spec really specify this is an element that needs focusing on when a presses on the tab overall I feel like the interview went pretty well you see that most of the questions I was asked were accessibility project related and that's honestly not even most it was all of them past the initial question of tell me about yourself and your experience history all the questions I got asked after that were based on my accessibility project which I feel like was a good thing this person was obviously very um interested in it and they ended the behavioral portion of the interview stating that it would be really great to have someone on the team who is so accessibility minded because that's an important thing for them but it can be hard finding people who really know the nuances it all inails so that made me really happy then there was the technical portion which wasn't um too difficult at all I was actually very surprised so I'm really happy about that however I did make a small mistake while implementing my solution I cated everything out but kept coming up with the wrong answer and the interviewer ended up saying that it's very clear that I know the answer and that I know how to implement the solution however it's probably that I'm very nervous being that it is an interview space but it's a very small minor mistake that I am just I just keep missing and so that was kind of annoying and I pray that that is not cost me this entire job so let's see but I have my fingers crossed really this person saying like no it's very clear that you know what's going on but X Y and Z I feel like that's pretty good um it gives me hope but again with big companies and competitive companies one little mistake can be what ends up at all so hopefully that's not the case but I will let y'all know but thank you for watching these were a couple days of my life as an unemployed software engineer going through this job hunt with y'all so let me know if you have any questions in the comments below and I'll talk to you all very soon"}
