{"video_title": "WOULD I STILL GO TO A CODING BOOTCAMP KNOWING WHAT I KNOW NOW \uff5c Coding Bootcamp Regrets", "transcript": "knowing knowing what I know now what I would I go back and would I recommend people to [Music] hello everybody my name is Naya and I'm the black female engineer I provide content for you and aspiring software engineers and today's topic is going to be coding boot camps I went to a coding boot camp back in 2020 in the midst myth of the pandemic I went from June of 2020 to October of 2020 and I went to one of the big ones I went to flatiron school I went to flat iron school for what what four months I think it was advertised as like a 15 week 16 week program so right around the four month range and through that time I learned about JavaScript I learned about Ruby Ruby on Rails and JavaScript framework react those are really the four I wanna right yeah those were really the four things we focused on throughout my time at boot camp at the end of it all I graduated with a job I actually graduated with a job which was insane and like absurd but the day of graduation was when I received my first job offers not the job I ended up taking but it was an offer and I ended up accepting a six-figure offer by the end of October so about three three and a half weeks after graduation which is really really amazing and so knowing all of this with this summary I just gave you you may be thinking like okay yeah she obviously endorses boot camps and because look I heard that's how she succeeded and that's how she got to where she is now because right now I work for a Fortune 50 company as a software engineer and isn't really great I really have been enjoying my time here however knowing knowing what I know now knowing what I know about boot camps knowing what I know about what it takes to get a job as a software engineer or as an entry-level you know Junior because yeah I'm very into level let's make that clear as entry-level developer and whatnot knowing what I know now about this migration into Tech would I would I go back and would I recommend people go back I think that I think this is so hard for me to talk about and say because I don't ever want to regret things you know that's not a fun feeling regretting an experience regretting a decision that's not fun because what am I gonna do now what am I supposed to do now just sit in it you know but I guess the answer to that is what I do now is use it for the future or use it to help other people and share my experience and so that's what I'm doing and that being said I would not go to a Canon boot camp at least at the very least I wouldn't go to the one I went to I I wouldn't go to the one I went to not flat iron School specifically because I really truly enjoyed my experience I loved flat iron School however one of the really hard things about coding boot camps is how notorious they are in providing different experiences depending on the cohort you're in depending on the location you're a part of the size the resources like it's it ends up being pretty just inconsistent and so for me what I'll say is it's not that I wouldn't go to flat iron school well it is but it's not what it is is I wouldn't go to a paid or an expensive coding boot camp knowing what I know now when I made the decision to become a software engineer I knew nothing about how to do so without a degree to me the only two options were get a degree or self-teach now at the time I had just graduated with my degree in finance and accounting literally graduated May of 2020 and joined up coding boot camp June of 2020 the following month I found out about coding boot camps around April and it was the first time I had heard of an option other than going back for a four-year degree slash Masters or self-teaching it's the first time I heard of a third it was the third door that I didn't know existed and so when I did my research and I saw the top three options pop up which were flat iron School general assembly and a boot camp part of like in my state like part of a local State College I thought oh this this is it is these top three especially because when I looked it up it was like yeah the best ones are these three and whatnot and so those are the ones I applied for those are the ones I interviewed for those are the ones I started choosing between between I had no idea that there were free options available I had no idea none no no idea that they were free or low cost options available maybe maybe with this rise of people getting into the industry without degrees and wanting coding bookings more affordable options became available in more free and non-profit options became available until maybe two years ago when I was looking they weren't as you know available maybe that's what it was but I'm sitting here now and I'm looking at all these options and I'm like damn I wish I had done that now why is it that I wish I had done that well first and foremost you already know the cost Flatiron School cost for me at the time I want to say eighteen thousand dollars I believe it was like advertised as 15 but if you get like a good job that offers a good salary you pay back up to around yeah 18 000 back because I did an income share agreement which meant I paid no money up front they've now removed that and that's honestly a conversation maybe for a different day the whole Scandal around income share agreements I think that's why flat iron and other companies have taken it away but yes I did an income share agreement and so almost 20 grand is a lot of money you don't think of it at the moment because for me what I was thinking was oh well if I get a good job then of course I'll pay this money back 800 a month or whatever if I get a good job like just give me the job you know what I mean like I cared more about getting the results I wanted so I was like oh whatever it's fine kind of like college when you're like oh let me take out fifty thousand dollars in loans like cool if I have a job after of course I'm paying it back and it's fine you're not truly thinking about the implications of those financial decisions and maybe you are if you're older I was 22 and I had been writing that wave of taking out a loan and then paying it back for my four-year Institution for the last four years and so to me that was just what you did but now I'm on this other side and I'm like Oh my goodness that's a lot of money that's a lot of money and I knowing that there was a way to avoid it I kicked myself for it to be honest even if I have the job even if I make a million dollars that that's still a lot of money second reason I wouldn't go to a big institution like that one is because the reason I went to a coding boot camp in the first place was because I simply needed Direction it wasn't because I couldn't teach myself the material it wasn't because I didn't think I could yeah do it on my own it was because I simply needed direction there's so much information out there and that's kind of like part of the point of this whole Channel there's so much information out there how in the world do you expect me to decipher all of it to create major career decisions you know and so I was like okay cool if I go to a coding boot camp I will be able to have a teacher somebody who knows the industry guide me along this path and say after you learn functions then you learn and this and after you learn JavaScript then you learned this and I needed someone to guide me because here I was self-teaching trying to teach myself Ruby on Rails not knowing Any Which Way what ruby was and what a framework was and why those are important and that's not good so I really did want a teacher someone to guide me that being said I can get a teacher now for a lot cheaper I can get a t-shirt now for almost kind of like I also want to say like free with the different courses people have put out and the different YouTube channels there are and whatnot especially me who is the type of person to if you tell me what to do you can you don't need to be the one to teach me I'll be the one to teach me I just need to know what to do I'll look up other teachers I'll look up resources I'll read the articles I'll read the textbooks I'll do all that is necessary when I really want a goal when I really have a goal in mind I'll do all that's necessary just tell me hey look here instead of here and I'll take it from there and so for you to just say like look here I can definitely find that at least now in a lot of different places places that I've even linked Below in my bio that I've talked about on this channel and so I wish yeah I think what it is I wish I had done more digging and more learning about coding boot camps before making the leap because to be honest I found out about coloring boot camps and I applied the next day and I accepted a boot camp within like a week a lot of people will say will a coding bootcamp help me get a job no it will not I'm here to tell you right now I'm here to tell you right now no it won't Corning boot camps will not help you get the job coding bootcamps will not get the job for you you truly truly have to do it on your own just as if you had gone so done self-teaching and done the whole previous months and years by yourself in my opinion the work I put in to get a job was no less than if I hadn't gone to a Korean boot camp and I think it's that specific question and that specific idea that's really what pulls the trigger into making people say okay I'll go to a coding boot camp because they advertise hey 97 of our graduates and everything get a job within six months however what they're not telling you is of that night it's 97 of graduates however only 50 of people graduated that's how they get you and like that's it sucks to say because again like I've gone through a common boot camp and again this is not like me bashing on flat iron school or any other boot camp this is not me doing that this is me Sherry Howe knowing X Y and Z I would have made different decisions I'm not saying that boot camps are not beneficial for some people however for me I don't think I needed it and to me boot camps are truly a last resort and so when you see these headlines of 97 graduates get a job within three months six months a year Etc they share that with the masses ask them okay cool what's your graduation rate and to be even more specific what's your graduation rate for like original class and so like how do I explain this so me at flat iron school there were three cohorts happening at the same time a cohort about two like sections chapters slash phases ahead of us and uh and a cohort about two phases under us I think that's how it was said I think I think of the people that I joined my boot camp with that I entered with first date these are the people these are my classmates it's all of our first days about half of us made it to graduation day now that being said some of them were yeah held back and everything and maybe graduated later on however they weren't part of like the Original Graduation group and so when you look at 50 of those people graduated and then 94 of those people got a job then you maybe want to say 50 or 60 of people get a job within three months or six months you know you know I feel like like the devil is honestly really in the details and Friday school did have career services oh pretty much all the big boot camps do have career services that being said ah they didn't do much for me and that being said another one another layer of that I also started job hunting and everything before they came into the mix and whatnot by the time they were like hey it's time to like review resumes and everything I was like oh I actually have like three interviews lined up but like I'll I'll get back to you if like I need you but I have spoken with like other people who did boot camps and whatnot and they echoed the same thing up no it's all on you but like it really is all on you they advertise the app resume help and services and Market interviews and whatnot but all of the things that they help with that they yeah like help with it's worth maybe like two or three hours of your time and their time when you really put it all together and I can tell you right now job hunting took more than two and three hours of my time so what free slash low-cost boot camps are available they're the ones that come to mind are added developers or is it Ada Developers I don't remember 88 developers are added developers that is a phenomenal one it's free you have to apply it's for women and gender non-conforming individuals and I've heard really really amazing things about their programs so there's that there's resilient coders which I believe is only available along the east coast but I'll have to double check but one that is available to really all likes of life and in person and not not even in person actually all virtual but live and I hear it's amazing is a hundred devs I believe it's run by a man named Leon and I hear phenomenal things about this man if you're watching you're doing amazing I hear phenomenal things about it and it's really just a man who I believe is is an instructor for a big coding boot camp but he puts in time and effort and work into teaching you all what it takes to be a developer and he has actual cohorts and classes and everything and do you apply and and all that and it's completely free all the ones mentioned are completely free there's also going to be links in my bio linking back to free slash low cost coding bootcamps but yeah this is not again a video to bash any big coding bootcamp I went to one and again I loved my experience I did I enjoyed my experience I loved my teachers so much I really really did however looking back would I do it again I think I would have loved to have done the free slash low-cost ones and so yeah I hope this was helpful now follow this up with videos on really what to consider when choosing a coding bootcamp along with just questions to ask the admissions teams and counselors and everything before you sign on the dotted line saying I'm going to become a student so make sure you subscribe so you don't miss those but yeah thank you all so much for joining me what are your thoughts what are you like yeah for your thoughts for your questions let's chat let's just yeah let's this is Chad let's just have an honest conversation okay okay all right thank you all for joining me I'll talk to you later bye"}
