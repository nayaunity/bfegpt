{"video_title": "WHICH COMPANIES PAY SOFTWARE ENGINEERS THE MOST \uff5c Levels Fyi Reveals Highest Paying Companies", "transcript": "oh my goodness i'm shocked i'm shocked i am i am shook it hello everybody my name is nyan i'm the black female engineer i provide content for you and aspiring software engineers and today yo i don't know if y'all have seen the levels dot fyi report levels.fyi simplest way to explain it is a glassdoor people go on there to report their salaries their benefits and things like that the thing is though it's definitely seen as the more credible or accurate resource because they verify all the information all the salary information they get from actually people uploading documents to support uh their russian cloud they're to support what they're saying and so they recently came out with a 2021 salary report saying which companies pay software engineers the most saying which cities pays off registers the most and oh my goodness i'm shocked i'm shocked i am i am shook it uh because okay when you think of the companies that pay the most for software developers i'm pretty sure the thing that comes to your mind is fang you know the facebook well now it's manga but now it's not even made and now mama going with the og thing it's facebook apple amazon netflix and google but in general that's typically what we think of of all the companies that pay the most like oh you must get into fame all the perks all the benefits of the cash and yet this report there's only one fame company in the top five companies that paid software engineers the best at least entry because this is focused on entry level on entry level software energy is the best and i'm like where did the rest go yeah let's just go right into it so starting with number five netflix netflix is reported to pay entry-level software engineers about 226 thousand dollars of total compensation at least for their first year now all broken down this comes out to 217 000 of the base pay plus 35 000 worth of stock and a twenty thousand dollar bonus but the base like brought and that's keep in mind this is number five like can you imagine number one but anyway now i'm sure i don't need to go into that much about what netflix is you know the streaming company they're based in california and oh my goodness when i looked at their benefits i they were i think my favorite in terms of the benefits they gave their developers so their benefits include but are not limited to free breakfast and lunch every single day a 200 match in donations and so if you donate to some cause some charity they will match 200 so you donate 5 000 they'll donate 10. and this is up to 20 000 but that itself blew my mind they also have unlimited pto and they have maternity and paternity leave of one year one year paid paid my job and they also have a transportation allowance with uber and lyft fully covered i don't know if that's to go to the office only and come home or if it's also like i'm trying to go to the club and need this left so i don't know about that if you work at netflix please let me know in the comments below but yeah i really really loved just those benefits and this is really interesting because netflix for the longest time only hired senior engineers and up but recently they started hiring more new graduates and so this is the comp and everything for new graduates and so yeah keep them on your mind number four stripe now broken down their compensation comes to a 132 000 base with a 75 000 in stock and then 27 000 of bonus so for those of you who may not know stripe is an irish american financial service software company and so if you've ever tried or if you currently run your own business and whatnot you likely have heard of stripe because they make it super easy and simple i feel like i'm in an ad they make it super easy and simple to engage in transactions with like to me not like that huge of a fee um because i use tripe as well and i really love i i personally love them i love their dashboard i love the way they go about displaying information and just making it so easy to get paid as an entrepreneur so i really like stripe and their benefits were also a big favorite of mine for some reason i don't know why the idea of maternity paternity why that's so important to me for right where i am right now but i have been like straight up just like a quick little change straight up in uh like college and when i interview for companies and everything i would bring up those subjects like hey i see that your paternity it's like it's not a given it's like they have to request it and maybe they'll get denied and then maternity is only like eight weeks like what's up with that like i'm a person who have i've always cared about that from just a right and wrong standpoint you know what i mean like there's just certain things that i feel like are right and are wrong and even though it doesn't apply to me right now or ever i care about it so yes all to say their fraternity and maternity leave is pretty good as well theirs is 16 weeks maternity and fraternity so i do like that it's the same for both because that's another thing i don't like when there's one another one together on top of that they offer free breakfast lunch and dinner and this was like huge to me 250 dollars worth of allowance for fitness gym and just wellness initiatives they also offer free therapy for up to 20 sessions which huge huge huge like yes please like that's amazing and i love that they do that i don't know if it's how it's divided up if it's 20 and that's it if it's 20 a year 20 quarterly i don't know but the fact that it's there in 20 is a good amount like that's one almost every two weeks if you do the whole year that's pretty good to me and so i love that they offer that they have a 4.0 rating and looking at their job listings and whatnot they have a nice amount of listings available right now i haven't seen listings for new developers all of them seem to be more like two plus three plus years but come the late summer fall you can definitely see more of that roll out and so keep in mind keep that in mind third on the list we have roblox now roblox is an online gaming platform that allows users to program games and also play games developed by other users which is really really cool and they pay their new developers 233 of total compensation for at least like year one it comes out to 144 thousand dollars of base 60 000 of stock and 24 000 of bonus pay like netflix and stripe they also offer free lunch but something different is they offer unlimited pto now here's the thing unlimited pto is something that is very much like good or bad depending on the company you work for i don't know how roblox does this on the i please know what i'm about to say about unlimited pto has nothing to do with them it's just considerations to make the thing is with unlimited pto i don't want to name the company um it's pretty much the biggest company you know you'll i've said it like three times already in this video they from my understanding used to offer unlimited pto but then they ended up taking it back and offering like a finite amount and the reason for that was because when they started offering unlimited pto they saw that less people took it which makes so much sense to me like me personally i would be less inclined to take it if i know that something is about to run out and i have 21 days use it or lose it i will use all 21 days i'll use all 80 days whatever number you give me i will use all of them oh i don't want to get demonetized but yeah i'll say i will use them if it's unlimited i don't know what it is now i wouldn't use them as much because i feel it's like oh well now is choosing to do x y and z when before it was in my choice before it was like yo like they're telling me i need to take the dates off so goodbye i'm going to but now it's like okay goodbye i don't know so that's my unlimited pto but that being said it has a lot to do with the culture of the company the culture of the company it's their responsibility to make sure that you know that it is okay and welcome to take time off and so i hope roblox is one of those companies if you ever interview for them or any other company that offers unlimited pto make sure you talk about that and you get clear on their stance on that not from the managers and whatnot but talk try to talk to the people who are actually working uh like who your co-workers would be so yeah just a quick side bit on unlimited pto but yes they offered they also offer laundry and gym on site which is i believe this watch netflix and tribe also offered but of all their benefits i that was like the least exciting ones i didn't mention it they have a 4.3 rating on glassdoor and it looks like 88 according to the surveys i saw and whatnot 88 of people do recommend working there so that's definitely something to keep in mind i didn't see any entry-level jobs out right now to apply to but again that's another one to keep on your list and as the months will buy and whatnot then really make sure you have those alerts on second to last we have bots boss offers total compensation of two hundred and thirty six thousand dollars zola's with 54 000 being stock compensation and then five thousand dollars being the bonus box is a california-based company that offers cloud-based content management their focus is really providing collaboration and file sharing tools for companies and so not anything like blitz and glam in my opinion but shoot for 236 dollars i might they have a 4.5 rating on glass door and 92 of workers recommend working there and so that's not a small number and at the end of the day i want to like where i work i want to be in a place where people are happy to be in because it's a job and it's just it's just a job it's a job that's affording me a certain lifestyle but if i'm sad crying on my reader work i don't know i don't know that's and really in terms of their benefits there wasn't too much listed i don't know if it's because they don't offer anything flashy or if it's simply because they just don't advertise it but really the biggest thing i saw which is still kind of iffy they offer remote work but i don't know if that's 100 of the time forever now or if it's just right now or if it's going to turn into a hybrid or whatnot but yeah in terms of benefits and just perks i couldn't find too much there but i mean the cash i'll buy my own gym membership with 236 thousand dollars so and then last but certainly not least we have two sigma that was the company levels fyi said was the best paying company to entry level software engineers at 000 of that being the base pay and 80 000 of that being the bonus so two sigma all in all is in new york city based hedge fund company that uses things like ai and machine learning and distributed computing to figure out the best trading strategies and so this is something that would for sure be very algorithmic heavy algorithmically heavy sure we'll go with it and so that's something you're not too confident in and do like really just like don't like in general then this may not be the company for you but if that sounds like the move for you then let me keep on going they offered pretty much the standard type of benefits like standard in the tech world with 20 days pto on-site laundry transportations type ins but the biggest thing that like stood out to me was their 20 thousand dollar relocation stipend keep in mind i don't know if this is validated i don't know if this relocations type in is for straight up anybody who moves from somewhere else wanting to move to that city or if it's based on a calculation of some sort like is it 20 000 cash or is it i don't know but that is something that made my ears break up a little bit because moving is not fun but for twenty thousand dollars it will be it can be i i can figure it out they currently have a glass door rating of 4.5 and so like all of these ratings are out of five and all of these companies have been four and above so definitely not something to like laugh at or to overlook in terms of open positions i did find like one position open for new grads but i'm not sure if it's still open because it was like via the third party site and i couldn't find it on their site on their site they do have many full stack and just other engineering positions for people with two plus years experience and so there we go y'all like oh my gosh this is what like a hundred and forty did i say 100 i meant a million like a million plus like a million two hundred thousand dollars worth of compensation in this list of five companies like oh my goodness for one year like oh my goodness but yes there we go after talking about all of this which companies are you leaning towards like which one would you want i'll tell you mine if you tell me yours i'll tell you mine in the comments below so check those out but yes there we go this was fun y'all i'll see you next week bye y'all"}
