{"video_title": "WHY I LEFT FINANCE TO BECOME A SOFTWARE ENGINEER", "transcript": "hello everybody my name is nyan i'm the black female engineer i provide content for you and aspiring software engineers and today we're going to talk about why i left finance and ended up in software engineering and so we're going to go a few years back starting in fall of 2016 i was set to start my first year in college i ended up being a finance major but before that i had to make a choice of what degree i wanted to pursue and i had put business as my first choice for the school that i wanted to attend you know the college when you know the whole establishment is the university there's the different colleges college of arts college of music etc so i wanted to be in the college of business but that process of figuring out if i was accepted into that specific track and all was going to take some time my business school was very competitive and so it would take a hot minute to find out even if i was accepted to the school it was going to take a hot minute and so in the meantime i had to enroll as some type of student because i was still accepted and i had still signed on to be a student of this university so i had to pick a subject of course and with me with the way i wanted my college experience to go i wanted to pick a track that would afford me a job right after college a job that would pay a solid amount and where i wouldn't have to stress too much about money now that being said if you're an underwater basket weaving major don't come at me there's nothing wrong with that i love that if that's what you want to do i love that but for me i went the more practical round i think it has something to do with being zimbabwean being the child of zimbabwe parents i just wanted to go that more practical round and for me that left me with engineering or business those were the two options now i had already chosen this but i didn't know if they had chosen me yet and so i signed on to attend my university under the computer science route i had signed on now before classes could even start i received notice that i got accepted into this one over here into the business school and so that's where i ended up that's where i wanted to go i wanted to be in business and so i was enthused and happy and all of that and so yes packed my bags went to school now it's interesting looking back there were very clear signs that i should have gone either the computer science or just the engineering minded route sign number one one of my favorite classes specifically my favorite class during freshman year of college was this class called mathematical analysis in business that's yeah i think that's what was math 11 12 mathematical analysis from business and i loved this course this course was made for me i would take it again because it was a course purely based off of excel excel analysis and using data points and inputs for business analysis now excel people who really know it professionally and can really code out these crazy spreadsheets it's a type of coding the things you can do it can end up being a type of coding and at the time i had no idea that that's what i was doing but i was the person other people would go to before exams to make sure that their spreadsheets were up and running up and good because my spreadsheets y'all i i wish i still had those my spreadsheets the teacher can be like oh so billy bob went to the market and got eight eggs and then this and then this and then the stock market went like this and all i would need to do is and put like one of those numbers and then boom there would the entire array of answers be right before me i was that committed to excel spreadsheets and i loved it so much that critical thinking that problem solving and just the act of creating these calculations that would produce these answers i loved that so much that should have been hit number one y'all it wasn't it wasn't to me i think it was just a further hint that i was in the right place does that make sense so instead of it being the hint that i was in the wrong place it was a hint that was in the right place because being a freshman you don't know what's going on in these different majors you don't know what you'd be doing and as a job and all of that and so i was like oh this is a class 4 business i love this class so much i must be right where i'm supposed to be but then moving on to work experience i ended up interning after my freshman year of college at elite garden six flags and i was a finance intern for them now i was very enthused to get this internship but did i decide that i wanted to go back no no i did not and this was the theme for everything i did y'all like this again should have been another hint hit number two that was in the wrong place i kept on no matter how great the company was no matter how esteemed they were i kept on rejecting the offer to go back so my first job decided not then after sophomore year i interned at a big four accounting firm did i go back no i was like nope i'm good this is not for me after junior year interned at bank of america merrill lynch and this is a top five bank i worked in derivatives i loved my team when it came to accept the offer to join them after i graduated full time did i accept it no i just kept on turning things down because i was like oh i guess maybe this specific route isn't it or i guess not that business wasn't it that thought did not just never crossed my mind as a student because what were my options i i am going to make this bread make this coin i need to get through this i'm not going to be switching majors i'm not going to delaying my graduation that was just not an option for me you know in my thinking i was like no that's that's not an option for me that's not the way to go i was spearheading down this road but yeah i just was like nope after trying certain things after applying certain places after interning i'd be like no no no no no so i mentioned bank of america merrill lynch so let's get back to that i entered for bank of america merrill lynch summer of 2019 so this was the summer after my junior year and after this i would just have one more year of college before i called it wraps so summer of 2019 i jet set to new york city manhattan and i was working for the derivatives team at bank of america not gonna lie to y'all i did not like my job again i loved my team i loved this company my day today i did not like it now hold up before any of y'all go into the comments like oh you're just an intern like of course you get you know clunk cloak work no it wasn't even that i didn't like my job i didn't like the my co-workers were doing i i just didn't like i didn't resonate with it i'm just thinking to myself like wow this is what i'd be doing it just didn't mix well with me until until the day that pretty much changed everything my manager one day came to me and was like hey girl hey girl hey youngblood um we would need these journal entries put in updated and all of that they're for the month update our books put them in and call it a day i was like bet say no more and so i look at this project i was like no i was like nah so here's the thing it was not a hard project i think the fact that it wasn't a hard project is i think what deterred me so much and let me explain why it's not a hard project what truly truly what it was was copying and pasting about 300 times that truly was what it was from one spreadsheet to another 300 times from you know the information they need to the journal entry information they need put it together boom here it was going to take me at least half the day all day because of just the sheer volume of everything so that's what i was like no i'm not no i'm not doing this like i would go insane i'm not doing this and so it was in that moment i was like there has to be a better way what what commercial is that i can't if someone please comment below please i beg you comment below what commercial is that where it's like there has to be a better way and i started looking up ways to automate things like this how to just make it easier make the machine work for me and me not having to like maybe some more leg work would have to be done in the beginning but the fact that this company's doing this every month i was like they will use this after i'm gone so what what needs to be done here to make that happen and so i spent like the whole half day from morning to mid afternoon that day looking up and practicing and finding ways to automate this process and by the end of that work day i had found a way to do that and i remember reaching out to my match i was like yo come over here come come over here and i just sit back and i press a button just and everything got populated and he was so impressed he even brought over a different employee it was like yo come over here look what nya just did and i did it i i sat back i said everything was populated so i was so happy they were so happy i was so happy to this day oh actually not to this day anymore because now i'm working so up till about three months ago this had been the happiest i could do not this had been the happiest i had ever at work i truly cannot think of another time i've ever felt this fulfilled this happy this eager i i was walking i remember calling i remember going to the bathroom and calling my mom immediately just so happy because i had never felt like this i had never like i was gonna make me emotional because i had never felt like this ever y'all and to finally have had a day where i felt like i had made a difference felt like i had contributed in a way that mattered and in a way that made me happy because it tapped into my problem-solving skills my curiosity and allowed me to learn and grow that was it for me all that was there for me now that being said y'all are gonna think i'm crazy for this bro what i'm about to say i still y'all i was like i said i was on a very narrow road everything else was black other than that path to get that degree i still didn't get that sign or take that as a sign of girl you need to move fields you this this finance is not for you you need to move fields immediately i still didn't realize it it still click that coding and developing and programming was what i was supposed to be doing or what i was supposed to be at least pursuing and it's really wild thinking back because i remember other co-workers talking to me talking about python programming and how that helps with finance and fintech and i truly was so removed from that conversation i didn't even think about it in a thing of me the only explanation i have for it and i hate to say it but it has to be said or else there will be no change is that i just never thought that i'm that person that that is a career that i was able i would be able to pursue i just certain things you put in your head as okay well billy bob does this and the jerry's of the world do this and the ambers of the world do this like certain things i think that's just how i think certain things i had just put in certain realms in certain compartments and that was also software engineering for me it took such a long time for me it's almost embarrassing to admit but for me to even realize software engineering was even a career path because growing up i wasn't surrounded by that so it took a very long time for me to even break open that option of nonaiya you too can be this person but anyway even then when i automated this process it still did not click to me that yo girl you should be trying to get into coding so it actually took about a year after that for me to see oh my gosh i love this and it was when this parent-teacher conference hit and now i had so much time on my hands because all of my classes went past fail and i was just i it's funny because i can actually envision myself literally in my bed just just letting the hours go by and so one day i was like nia girl you have been given the gift of time use it use it and so i remembered i had one like been interested in programming or not and it's funny to even say that because not interested in programming in the sense of oh i really liked math 11 12 i really automating this process for bank of america let me try coding it wasn't even like that it was just a thing where you know things pop up that everyone says to try or everyone says to pursue that's really where that came from and coding is one of those things and so i was like okay everyone says to do this thing let me try it so i tried it and literally within hours hours i was hooked i remember that first week staying up till four in the morning just trying to complete coding projects and building static sites and all of these things because i just couldn't put it down it had never felt like that in finance i've never been like oh i just can't put down these journal entries let me just stay for one more hour because i just love this so much now if you do no shades no shade i'm just saying that was not me and so that is when truly within just a few days when i was like yeah i i need to move i need to make a switch i need i need to make this happen and i was just a few months away from my graduation which was in may of i was a few months away from that so i couldn't just switch majors and so i looked at all the different things i could do ending up with a coding boot camp now in terms of the story here i have so many videos as to coding boot camps and even what i did during coding boot camp along with after coding boot camp to get a job so i'm not going to go too deep into that because i just don't want to repeat myself but i'll link those videos below and some will appear up here but yeah decide to go to a coding bootcamp and come the point where i was supposed to start looking for jobs i actually reached out to my manager at bank of america from the previous year it was like hey i'm pursuing this new route i would love to hear what your thoughts are in terms of job opportunities i loved bank of america even though i didn't like this specific realm of it is there any track that you can recommend for me is there any other program you guys have x y and z and he really tried his best but unfortunately all the programs they had for new graduates and new students or or just young people in general you needed a computer science degree and this is really where i first started panicking thinking oh my gosh am i going to get a job i don't have a computer science degree i have a finance degree but i don't have a computer science one am i not going to get a job because of it and so that's really where i started to panic because of that now i want to say you don't need a computer science degree to do this work some companies or some programs they do require it but you will find many many that don't but yeah i ended up moving on from that and now i work in commerce cloud development so i'm very happy with how all of this turned out i wanted to provide you this story to really give you more of a complete look into my journey those of you who have followed me since the very early days first of all i see you thank you so much but you may have heard snippets of this scattered through different videos but yeah i just wanted to provide a space where it was everything just put at once but now we're on the same page of my journey and i'm so excited to just produce more content for you all in terms of transitioning and being a new developer being in this field and yeah so please let me know in the comments ways i can help you out please and follow me on instagram at the black female engineer i love answering your questions i love just talking to you to be completely honest and so no reach out here on instagram etc but i hope you enjoyed this if you did please subscribe hit that like button and i'll see y'all later bye"}
