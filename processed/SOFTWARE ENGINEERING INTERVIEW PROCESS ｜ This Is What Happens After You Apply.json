{"video_title": "SOFTWARE ENGINEERING INTERVIEW PROCESS \uff5c This Is What Happens After You Apply", "transcript": "hello everybody my name is nya and i'm the black female engineer i provide content for new and aspiring software engineers and today we're going to be talking about what the software engineering interview process looks like now this is going to be more of a conversation i do have tips as to how to go about certain interviews and job hunt tips and things like that i'll link those above and in the description box below but this is going to be more of a talkative video so anyway let's get to it so you already applied to a job congratulations because that in itself is a grueling process so congrats on sending out those resumes make sure you're tracking the amount of applications you're sending out i'll have my job tracker in the description box below free to download free to use just follow the instructions and hopefully that helps with that tracking but okay what comes next this is all from my experience it's not you know law it's not it's different for everybody but this was my experience so typically within two to five weeks is when i would hear back from a company i would hear back on whether i got you know an interview or whether i you know just didn't get the job within that time frame usually now just you know a little note over here don't be discouraged by seeing constant rejections for interviews y'all once i when i say once i mean just a few months ago when i was applying i got a rejection notification two hours after i had applied to that job i was like wow what could i have possibly said that this person was just like not this she is not the one boom so just remember that and just keep your head up but typically yes between two and five weeks is when i would hear back about some type of update now let's say i got an interview what how this typically looked was i would get an email from a recruiter asking me um for to validate certain information validate the location i was applying to or the location i live in just like things like that and so typically once i got this email i knew that i was being considered and they're just you know crossing their teeth and all of that one of two things happened i either would get asked for a very quick phone um conversation it's still an interview i tweeted everything like an interview like all of it but you know more of like a conversation about 15 to 20 minutes where the recruiter learns more about me and my background and i learned more about the you know opportunity either that or i would get sent a hacker ring challenge now what is hackering hacker inc is a resource that companies use to administer coding challenges to applicants it's the way that they try to assess um in applicant skill sets now you know i have my own opinions on technical interviews and things like that but yes that is how they typically went about that so one of these two things would happen so let's start with this round i get an email asking for availability for a 10 to 20 15 to 20 minute conversation i would then set up that meeting conversation slash interview with that interviewer via google you know calendar and all of that and when we would start talking it would be more you know behavioral in um in structure seeing where my background is learning more about my projects and my interests going forward those are typically the main three topics seeing my transition into software engineering because i had transitioned from a different career so hearing that story and then hearing about what tech stack um i prefer if i'm interested in learning more um and just like my learning style um and coding style and then what i am looking for in a company and so those are really the main three things they hit every single time now if they liked what they heard within a week of that i would get notice of if i can have a second interview slash of you know next really formal longer interview about 30 to 45 minutes up to an hour and so this interview would really dive into do i know definitions do i understand what oop is do i understand what agile development looks like or the software development life cycle really just proving that i know my stuff especially because i didn't get a computer science degree really them honing into that now if they liked what they heard there then i would be invited for a technical interview this technical interview would typically be a live interview where i would be given a challenge right on the spot something like i can't even think one something like you know loops and working with arrays and objects in javascript i typically would be able to pick my coding language so i always chose javascript and yeah them saying how do you solve this and then i talk through it and you know walk through my solution and then try to handle anything they throw at me i would get between one and two questions of this and then after that typically then it was it that was it and i would hear back from the company in about like a week to ten days after that so the whole process after getting that initial invite that initial interview would take about four weeks max that's typically how things went but then it already had taken two to five weeks and two is rare typically about four weeks for me to even hear back on that status of my application to begin with so overall it would be about an eight week process for that one job now let's say we go into the other section the other of the two paths we could have chosen where i right off the bat was given a hacker ring challenge right for my application they sent me a hackering challenge even this this is something they don't do to everybody so if you get a challenge don't think oh like they do this to everybody it doesn't mean anything like no that means a lot actually because you already have beat out a significant amount of applicants if you even get that first challenge so no be proud of yourself for that and know that you are in the running to be a part of this company so we get the hackering challenge and i would typically have about one and a half to two hours to complete the challenge now that sounds like a lot yo it is nothing it is nothing no time at all like the amount of times i have ran out the clock is insane so you think it's like oh wow like that's so much time like i'll do it in just a few minutes like maybe you will you know like i'm not saying you won't but just know that time will fly and you'll look up and be like how do i only have five minutes left and in my case like how do i have five minutes and i've completed 10 10 of the problem that's a sort of a different day so doing this hacker rank really just trying to make sure you answer all the questions hacker rank um has up the company typically from my understanding typically chooses the questions um it asks for and tells you this is what your solution should look like and so you're just working trying to figure it out you can typically i typically worked on my own ide unless it explicitly said that i couldn't then i would work specifically in hacker inc but during this you typically couldn't you know google anything ask a friend call a friend you couldn't do any of that again i would say it in the challenge that you can't do these things i have had challenges sent where it explicitly said that i could which you think is a good thing but and but then you realize it said that because it knows that there is no resource out there that can help you so might as well you know waste your time googling the x y and z and so that's why it would do that looking back that is typically the only times it would say you can search things but anyway so do this hacker rank one and a half two hours gone present prescend and within hacker rings were rough in terms of knowing when i'd hear back that was more of a shake up i could hear back anywhere from three days after to three weeks after once i didn't hear back from a company after i submitted my hacking until like three months later and they're like oh do you want an interview and i'm like no like that ship has sailed like no keep your interview like i was just like really like and it was a company that um was one i admired very much too and so like when i saw that it kind of just ruined my day i was like are you serious are you sick but anyway anyway so anywhere from three days to a couple of weeks i would honestly prepare for something like two and a half to three weeks i think that would really be the average i would see and depending on how you did you would either get an automated message saying sorry we decided to go to with other applicants or then we would go to a behavioral interview which was about 30 to 45 minutes and then a technical interview typically another technical interview and then see if you can offer so the two routes you know were very similar except one you know started with a hack rank or one started with a very quick 10 15 20 minute conversation but after that it kind of went through um the same way i would always prepare by practicing behavioral and technical interview questions i actually have like a 10-page document filled with interview questions and answers that i would type in um and just practice those and i'll you know what i'll link those questions below i'm trying to think of the questions i believe yeah i'll link those questions below because you know hopefully it provides you with some type of starting point at least for what you should look at but it's very very comprehensive and so if you don't know certain things don't freak out or anything there's still some things on there that i was never able to answer um but it just provides you with like if you can't answer like at even like 50 of these you are in a very good spot so i'll link that down below um so you know it's free to use for you to download just follow the instructions looking back i wouldn't really say there was anything i would change other than my attitude i think anyone who knows me knows i am just a warrior like crazy especially because i'm such a planner because i want to just you know be prepared for anything that i would just like this whole process was just not good to be honest for like my own mental well-being um and so if i could go back i wish i had that attitude of you know what if you want me you want me if you don't you don't like life goes on um because honestly that's what it is like even if you know you're self-taught even if you're coming at this from coding boot camp or you know a computer science degree people are going to find good and bads from all of these things all of them nothing just qualifies you off the badge just everywhere and nothing is just good everywhere people are going to find something to be like no actually this is bad because x y and z or actually we wanted someone who had more x y and z or less x y and z like at the end of the day i am who i am and honestly i would treat and i don't need to roll your eyes at this because i would have rolled my eyes if if i watched a video that said this but i would treat that as like a blessing like i saw this there's this quote um that's like you can ask someone of something and two things one of two things will happen they'll either oblige and give that thing to you or they'll admit that they can't give it to you and walk away both are blessings and this is something that i would apply to interviewing job hunts as well because if a company doesn't want you then it means that it would have been a company that even if you were hired there that you would not have been happy in because maybe they're too you know too like buttoned up and stern old school or they're too like out there unprofessional and all over the place or you'd have way too many duties or not enough duties and things like that so honestly treat it as a blessing that a company is not wasting your time of bringing you through this process when they know that you are not the person for their culture for their atmosphere and things like that again it's so much easier to say this now so i really just am not treating this lightly but at the end of the day you are who you are your journey is your journey and you must own that and if a company does not like that to like okay buy but a company will like that and that is the company that will truly value you as a professional and as a person and that is where you'll hopefully end up really truly being happy so that's my ted talk for the day y'all but no i hope this video just allowed some insight of what to expect once you start your job hunt or if you've just started and are in that you know limbo stage of waiting to hear back from things and all of that so if you have questions for you know interviewing or any of that please comment below like i hope you've seen by now that i really love to interact with you all um you can also interact with me on instagram so please let me know and i'll see y'all later bye"}
