engineer I provide y'all with some Tech Career life content and today yo we are talking about something I've been talking about for a long time in like my own circles and that is quiet quitting because my oh my gone are the days where I give 110. percent [Music] so what is quiet quitting let's start there why quitting is kind of what I just said you no longer are giving 110 at your job you're not quitting you're not leaving but while you're staying you are staying within the bounds of your job description you know what I mean you are mentally letting go quitting the idea that to be a good member of society that means killing yourself for a job during a job I remember when I worked in finance people would brag about how many hours they put in about how they slept at 4am and are here back at six and that would be like this token this kind of thing that seems to have real monetary value but it's like why did you do that you're getting paid just the same so like what's that about but man long gone are those days at least for me and like some like-minded people I myself was born outside of the United States and I always had the idea that to succeed in this life that meant going to school getting a good education and getting a great job and being the best employee at that job that is what made your life worthwhile you know and I bought into this I really did I remember I was one of the first of my friends to get an internship out of college at a big four accounting firm as a sophomore do you know like that was pretty like that was a big deal then the next year I had an internship at a Big Five bank and so I spent a good amount with my adolescents with this idea of for my life to have any real value it needs to somehow be tied back to work and what I do nine to five so what happened what happened because it seems like that was the sentiment of a lot of people my age what happened well yeah yeah that happened covid happened covet happened and everything all of a sudden just stopped stop all of a sudden we don't know what tomorrow looks like I mean like truly truly I I don't know about you I don't know maybe you were a doctor in fauci's office but I didn't know what tomorrow looked like day by day for like a year a year and a half and that's terrifying especially like I am honestly so blessed that nobody in my family or those I cared about were directly impacted in a devastating Way by covid-19 but so many people in so many families were and so kovit gave all of us as a society the opportunity to reflect the opportunity to sit back and think on what we find most important in this life because as it turns out it's not forever on top of that we are now seeing that the rewards that once were offered to the people who worked hard and picked the extra shift and worked over time they're no longer here they have they have disappeared what rewards for example buying a house that's a big one that's a big one I personally have been talking about and to have been like upset about because I've always wanted to own a home yo did you know that right now in 2022 the average home price is four hundred thousand dollars now depending on where you are that may not seem crazy but when you think about how that that is a 30 increase from last year what that's not sustainable last year the average home price was a little over three hundred thousand dollars that means most people most of America even if they put in double ships even if they find a side hustle will not be able to afford a house anytime truly soon it wasn't that long ago that Tech experience one of the biggest layoffs in the recent years this last spring and summer so many companies have been laying off their Tech workers and their toe teams and departments and yet you expect me to hold this company up with such like admiration and oh 110 no like what so what does quiet quitting look like in practice like actually actually what does it look like I actually I to be honest I kind of wish it was a different it was a different name because the idea of quiet quitting I think it is what's the word what's the word what's the what's that word for it's not being represented correctly like it creates assumptions that aren't correct to the name I'm gonna know the word and I know y'all are yelling at me saying the word that it is and I cannot think of it I can't think of the word but to me when I hear quiet quitting I think of leaving without telling anybody you know what I mean I think slowly packing up your laptop and leaving and just never showing up again never answering your phone never answering your email just never showing up again that's what I hear when I hear quiet quitting and that's not what that is it doesn't mean being a bad worker it doesn't mean leaving everything and everybody that's not what quiet quitting means quiet quitting in practice is doing your job quiet quitting in practice is not okay here actually I'll edit that it's not doing your job it's doing the job you were hired to do not the job they now have created because it's been x amount of months and now like oh here's more work and more work and more work and oh but it's your job no that's not the job I was hired to do with this pay stub of ten dollars an hour that's not what you hired me to do I need to calm down I'm getting revved up I'm getting really rubbed up here I get so upset like I seriously get so upset because like I feel like it's only corporate where this expectation of giving your all and receiving pennies back and receiving just crumbs back is so wildly it's so widely accepted as like the correct thing like it gets so mad because how many times do we tell our friends do we tell our loved ones like oh you're putting X Y and Z in the relationship and you're not getting XYZ back leave or that's not a good friendship that's not a good relationship why the hell are you staying and yet in corporate we're expected to do that and if we don't do that we're a bad word like I get so annoyed by that but to get back on track quiet quitting is simply doing the job you're hired to do if it's said on your job description or it was understood between you and your manager that your job is nine to five why are you showing up at 8 30 why are you showing up at eight hell why are you showing up at 8 your job is nine to five be there nine to five you get a 30 minute lunch be at lunch for the Whole 30 minutes and don't answer your phone from your boss from your manager and everything unless it's a true true emergency don't like they can deal without you for 30 more minutes that is what quiet quitting is no more no no more of that it's so funny because I'm thinking about examples where maybe I was in a company culture that really drilled into like we must do X Y and Z above even though you're getting paid nothing or even if you are getting paid something it's still not what the agreement was in terms of hey we agreed this is the job I would do and one of the examples I have is I used to work I I I'll drop the name here I actually don't care that much I used to work at ey as an intern and at ey I was a like tax what was I like an audit slash tax intern I don't even remember but they worked my team worked at a single conference table because they would have to go to their clients like the teams would have to go to the client site a lot of times the clients just had a big conference room for them to work at which meant you were working at the same table as your boss and your manager and your co-worker and your intern you all were in this big long table at lunch everyone would eat their lunch at that table and like eat their lunch while like doing work no even then even at the mere age of 18 years old I was like nah fam like no that's a big no for me and so I would get up walk across the room at noon as you should oh walk across the room get in my car and go and go somewhere for lunch sometimes dead dead dead dead serious sometimes I wouldn't even have anywhere to go because I brought a lunch and I would simply go in the car and eat in my car simply for the piece of it because what am I supposed to do I'm like sit in this conference table and talk to no one and have no true break it's important in general to just have a break to have a moment to breathe and now I can't even have that oh no you got me messed up if you think I'm not going to sit in my car instead of handling being part of this situation no not at all real quick please know I'm not saying anything bad about ey at all I'm just sharing my experience uh I really liked my team I really like my manager I mean it was still it was real I don't work there anymore uh that's just something to share because you know transparency and like it's not that deep and so how can you implement why quitting in your own day-to-day in your own nine to five they'll actually contribute to one a better life work balance but also just a better nine to five in general one of my favorite tips for this is before you get assigned any extra work let's say you already are juggling a couple of things they're all within your job description but things are just yeah they're juggling around and you're getting stressed because yeah deadlines are coming and it's just a lot now your major comes in and says hey add this to the list pretty please and scurries off instead of just taking that and being like shoot okay guess I'm gonna have to put more unpaid hours to complete this and that really sucks and you know crying to yourself at your desk about it instead of just taking that say Hey okay so you also want this done and there they'd be like yes so then say okay cool here are the things I'm currently working on what exactly and like I'm I sound passive aggressive right now because I'm very riled up but this would not be the passive aggressive way at all but you'd be like okay cool here are the things I'm working on right now could you let me know which things I should de-prioritize in order to get this done by the timeline you want done do you see how easy that is it's their job as a manager to help you succeed at your job and asking questions like these it lets them know okay I'm juggling X Y and Z right now and I'm the kind of worker who wants to make sure I provide you the correct product a good product even though it's not it may not be like exceptional because you don't pay me for that but it's a good product I care about that which I put off to the side for the time being in order to get to the thing that you now want me to work on that is a more than okay question and it's also a question that in the future will help the manager realize like okay let me make sure that this person does have the capacity to accomplish XYZ a code specific example is making sure that the tickets you create either create for yourself or your managers are creating for you make sure that they are tickets that are small don't be creating tickets or don't accept tickets that are create this new page create a new home screen page that to me truly truly sounds like at least 10 tickets at least 10 tickets because we need likely that home screen has a navigation bar luckily it has some images it has maybe some animation effects when you scroll it has a footer it has a contact me section it has all of these different things so you need to create tickets for each single chunk there this is so important for so many different reasons not just the quiet quitting part of things but also just productivity because instead of spending x amount of days or weeks on this big thing and having to say to your boss every single day like oh I'm still working on it I'm still working on it and there's really no nothing for them to see that you've accomplished now every day or every other day you come to them with a completed task you did the nav bar you did the body you did the contact me section you did all of these different things and now you your co-workers and your boss all recognize that progress is being made rather than simply relying on your word because everything had been previously put in just one ticket which is going to take weeks to accomplish so when things are in one ticket like that it also creates this heightened sense of urgency and we again don't want that and just quiet quitting era we don't want this false sense of things need to be done yesterday we don't want that let's allow work to be the thing that supplements the life we want to live not what hinders it okay y'all and I hope it's very clear that again I'm not advocating being a bad worker I'm advocating you doing the job you are hired to do and getting paid for the job you are hired to do but yeah that's it y'all let me know what y'all think Below have you heard about quiet quitting is this the first time what are your thoughts and let's just chat so thanks y'all for being here and I'll see you next week bye"}
