extremely small it's literally just this wall right here this is a um like Supply Closet where I keep my cleaning items and I'm going to show you a quick layout of my apartment so you so you can see the predicament I'm in I just don't know where to put my desk until last night I was like man I'm building apps all the time I'm editing videos all the time I need an actual place to like sit usually I sit at my Island where like those two chairs are but it's like no I I want a monitor I want you know multiple screens and everything so I took a walk around my apartment and it was like you know what this wall isn't doing anything it's not doing anything for anybody so let me let me do something here okay I ordered some tools because from from the videos I watched to get the desk the desk to get the door off of its hinges I need a hammer and either a nail or a screwdriver and I don't have that cuz after all I'm only just a girl don't forget I'm also just a girl oh wait oh thank God I was like shoot I don't want to open all these boxes to find the tool set so I just picked one and prayed for the best look at God it's all pink and cute so you know I like it oh I did it oh that's so cool I'm not a handy person at all let me give you a quick peek here this is not like the biggest closet but I think it'll be cute when I take it all out and make it into like that office type closet okay cool cool cool cool let me take out all this cleaning stuff [Music] and [Music] it open [Music] please okay all it's open okay I pray to God this isn't a to set up because the picture makes it seem

okay there's a slight chance I'm going need to go to Home Depot to get that power [Music] drill I just want to get to decorating so quickly what time is it so like the next thing is literally to just anchor to the wall but I have instructions for drywall application in non- drywall what does that mean to me um not much because like where well I I I don't I don't know what that means what what are the options drywall or like cement oh my God oh God okay let me call my dad hold on hello yo how are you are you doing good I'm trying to mount um something onto my wall well is the next day and it's

haul so yeah let me show youall I literally literally got kind of like everything you could get for a desk from the monitor down to the lamp and Decor I wanted especially since it has this desk has that ladder style I was like let me put some hanging plants at like the top shelf so it can droop down okay then I have this lamp it's a cute little mushroom and it comes with remotes cuz it has different light settings so I was like hell yeah for like mood setting and everything oh that's so cool it feels like a mushroom too I I didn't think it would I thought it was going to be like hard I didn't think it would feel like a mushroom like all plush oh it's my digital clock oh that's so cool it's all it's like very reflective I got some storage bins because now I have an exposed closet I was like let me get some storage bins where I can put in things like camera equipment gear things like that without it looking now hectic okay awesome I think this is my laptop pad or like desk pad yes it is oh that's perfect okay so this is the first thing I'll put down after I clean the desk is the Whiteboard so when I'm coating I love having a whiteboard to write out my MVP my just next steps and things like that it just like I don't know it helps me problem solve especially if I'm debugging and so that's a cute little whiteboard and here's my keyboard oh my goodness I'm so excited I've never gotten like a cute keyboard I always just use the default keyboard on my laptop okay and finally is my monitor y I'm looking at this now I hope this isn't too big for the desk oh no oh no Well it can't possibly it can't possibly be this big though I'm thinking like this hopefully okay ready set go oh there's this cardboard in here I was like excited for like a okay now let's move the cardboard and hopefully it's that hopefully it's that moment [Music] I'm pretty notorious for not measuring things and this is what happens when we don't not even not measuring things not checking the dimensions of things I order but it's okay nothing little scissors can't fix oh no does this not fit you know what it's okay let me just take off this Shelf [Music] okay now that I'm setting up I realized there a couple things I'm missing and I just looked at my um account my Amazon account and it looks like this one package was dropped off in our mail room which is extremely not secure um and
