Let's Move To Mexico City In The Meantime", "transcript": "I will get up I will get up I'll get up I'll get up I'll get up okay it is 12 I don't know that is it is 1:28 um Friday September 29th my lease is done officially done tomorrow I'm leaving tomorrow and yeah I got to do some packing a lot of the things I have I honestly will be just throwing away I'm a person who travels pretty lightly usually when I move or whatever it's really just like two suitcases full of like clothes and everything so pretty much same thing here now the thing is though there are a good amount of things I wanted to ship to my parents house that um it's raining like crazy if you're in your or around New York you probably know it's raining pretty bad um so the UPS tour is a couple blocks away and I'm like I do not I do not want to go over there and do that there's really just a couple of things left here I have a lamp I have a coffee table a bench um a mirror a beautiful mirror I love this mirror so much I'm sad that you know I'll be leaving it um I think somebody's coming to pick it up so it should be fine and I have a little like bookcase is that about it I think that's about it in terms of furniture so I'll be okay throwing away most of these things I need to get dressed and do some filming for a brand bad timing definitely but you know let's do it it'll be fine no this is really weird for me this is the first time I'm like really kind of living day by day to be honest um I guess more like month by month and it's been that way for a couple months now um just making plans one month at a time and just seeing how I feel at the end of that month and going from there but yeah I'm going to Mexico City for the month I have a really really gorgeous like beautiful Airbnb that I'm so excited to check out and I honestly have no other plans other than just recharging this last year in New York has been 50 Shades of amazing and exciting um but also like very like difficult in some aspects I really really appreciate the last year though because like I saw more things than I could have ever like thought I would see I was on like every single Adventure IM man imagin Jesus imaginable I went to shows and you know clubs and partied and cried and like had just not great things happened but had really amazing things happen like I really no one can say I did not live up my year um and honestly when I think about what people think of when they think of New York like let's say I was watching like a New York movie of a 20 something person um I my last year very much lives up to that um and more like you don't want a movie to just be good like amazing the whole time like you want it to have a plot and you know drawbacks and questions and fear and all these other things and my year definitely had that so like I'm extremely grateful for this year that being said I am extremely excited for like what there could be away from this year not even like away from New York like away from this year like everything that has happened in the last year I am content with packaging it up and like leaving it there um and so now it's like okay so what what's next then and it's hilarious because like I literally complained about New York City like pretty much every day that I was here except for the last like six weeks and like people say like hey like your first year in New York City is going to be grueling and testing like the the universe knows your demons and will pull it right out and shove it in your face if you live in New York City and that's what happened to me um and I felt it all the way through and so for a very long Tel I was like I want to leave I want to leave I want to leave I I want peace there's no peace here I'm like I'm just not having a good time but over the last few weeks like 6 weeks or so there's definitely been a change in perspective where like it's very difficult here and I'm probably still going to feel it difficult but I started seeing more of the magic of New York again I think it's because um I've been wanting to be more creative in my next chapter I want to be really really Allin into content but also Arts I I really want to paint I really want to dance and be Musical and take classes for different things and now I'm like I don't know if Mexico City if that's the place to do that because like New York is Arts capital of the world you know so I don't know if leaving it will be the right choice for me cuz that's really where my mind has been L specific on Arts so again this month is going to be very much looking for Clarity on things okay let's go film so usually I film in front of this window I'm not wearing official bottoms because you know what we're not seeing that part so it's fine okay I really liked that um I'm actually shocked at how quickly I was able to talk through it cuz I really do love this brand and I want y'all to be able to like use their resources and their tools and so let me do some editing real quick it's so loud because of the rain and so and because of the echo so I need to put in some noise reducing like software and yeah hopefully it gets to a place that I'm like okay that's good let me submit it for a review so let's see okay I just submitted the um videos for the brand look over I'm kind of tired to be honest though um the rain's lightened up and I think this is a good time for me to run over to the UPS okay that was not so bad at all the man who helped me was extremely extremely nice I wish him nothing nothing but the best for him and everyone he loves but yeah I asked I was like how much would like a 20x 20 box filled with clothes be like to ship and I said like to Denver how much would that be and he's like oh like the standard rate with you know anybody would be about $60 I bought three boxes this is how big they are so I bought three of these cuz I'm like no way am I shipping more than $360 boxes cuz that's now $180 before tax and everything and that was just an estimate so I'm going to like also like really really be mindful about what I'm taking because like I need it needs to have a value in my head of at least $60 um or not even the item but like the box in general it's like okay if I had to put a value to all the items in here would I say it's $60 and if I can't say yes then something's not getting shipped so that's pretty much all of this and again it's mostly just clothes there's going to be some shoes that I need to put away that's definitely going to be like one solid box but yeah don't mind these because this these I'm taking with me so so it's really everything on the perimeter um minus the bedding the bedding I'm just going to throw away I just feel bad throwing away right now I think I'll wait till the last minute to throw it away so it's really just these items so I don't don't even think I'll need the three bags um I mean the three boxes maybe just like I don't even know one one and a half and so I really don't think it's going to take a lot a long time I'm tired I'm going to take a break oh my this is watch let's watch some love is blind I think hold on yo I need to see this um the honeymoon episode The like preh honeymoon oh this is about to be a whole of his blind thing like it just really helps that she's like so hot okay move to the kitchen cuz I have things to do I need to um remove the dent on this purse so I just put the teac kettle on and I'm just going to I'm just going to like hold it over it to like steam it a little bit I'm going to proceed to clean this kitchen some more um yeah while watching Love is bun I'm still watching it it is right up here so [Music] yeah not him saying well if you look like this I would love it I do look like like he said she hasn't put on makeup up since that day and you've seen me every day since she doesn't have makeup on so what's the issue [Music] wow [Music] this is where we're at so like honestly just finishing touches the main problem is this room specifically because of the bathroom well go go to the roof take up that amazing view and go to bed okay so it's the next day I'm pretty much packed I'm trying so hard to close this and I can't get it closed and I'm getting very frustrated no okay I'm going to take this out and move this to here um that's going to have to do let me you know I'll just throw this away it okay now honestly I'm just throwing things into boxes I don't even care anymore here let me just close it and maybe I'll tape it at the facility because I don't want to like in case I need to open it up again again for something so for now let me just close it I'm going to call an Uber to help me drop these off and then I have this bag of books that I'm going to donate to the like little cute Library um I'll open this oh my gosh I'm exhausted I have not eaten it is just before 12:30 so I'm running behind cuz I wanted to leave by so let me bring these boxes downstairs and call the Uber to get me to the post [Music] office okay so I um just took the boxes to USPS I'm extremely just not doing well right now the USPS took a very very long time like it took an hour I thought it was going to be just drop it off but it took an hour because of how first trying to get an Uber that would fit the boxes and then getting the boxes inside and everything people helped me which I'm so grateful for okay um I will like a permanent home so bad and I think like I'm treating going to Mexico very much as an intermission and trying to figure out where I'm going to go and where I'm going to be it sucks cuz like there's so many wrong choices or right choices that are wrong still in some way and it's hard for me to make a decision and just stick with it but I really am sick and tired of moving around so much I have not stayed in a place for this now actually is the longest I've stayed somewhere in like I think like 4 years and I was here for like 10 months 9 months and before that I stayed mad Max like 6 months places at a time for the last like yeah for the last like 4 years I just want just be settled somewhere and have a community somewhere and just not feel so alone [Music] everywhere I'm going to close my suitcase and um put my I away okay okay okay okay I will get up I will get up I'll get up I'll get up I'll get up I get up okay okay this is me getting up I'm getting up I'm getting okay not going to lie I was relying heavily on having inlight Wi-Fi to help me pass the time I was going to spend whatever was needed to get inlight Wi-Fi and they're they're claiming there is like free Wi-Fi but that's the worst Wii that's the worst WiFi y'all should see my setup I don't know how I ever not have three seats to myself on a plane and I don't even know how that happened because my seat wasn't assigned until I was we were boarding I had to like go to the gate agent and get the a seat and I was happy that it was a window seat but then I get here and we take off and it clicks I'm like wait a damn minute there's no one next to me so I have food here movie here elephant drinks purse and electronics to be honest I would prefer this over at first class I I am in luxury once uh oh we're on the road the only thing left to like that's like really like on my mind is getting the hotel reservation cuz I didn't I haven't gone there yet it's this um like specifically like local um hotel which I stayed in for a couple nights last year um due to a hilarious story that I can talk about later but I had to fle my Airbnb and go to this hotel and it was so ridiculously cheap it was like I think like $15 a night but still so gorgeous so um yeah I I'm hoping they have room I remember last time I booked it the day before not even the day before last time I booked it the day of and so I was just going to do the same thing and pray for the best I only need it for one night cuz my airb be check in is at 3: uh tomorrow [Music] so okay so the hotel does not have and so I hit up my airb host and he is letting me check in early my U is almost here so yes let's go oh my goodness okay we made it I'm so tired I believe it's just before midnight my Airbnb host was kind enough to open up the apartment a day early so I'm really really grateful for that this apartment is so cute um but now I'm just itching to see it in the day because like the lighting isn't great and so I really want to see it during the day because it has like these huge like screen doors and like that makes up most of like the like most of not all of the wall both upstairs and upstairs and downstairs um I can't think y so I'm very excited to see it during the day something I did not think about was Cooling and I don't know if there's bugs because I would open the screen door but there's no netting so I'm trying to think like should I open the screen door to let some of the cool air in or no I don't know about that but um yeah I think for the rest of the night I'm going to do quite a bit of editing because I really want this video up by tomorrow afternoon so yeah I'll just put on some TV and yeah yeah thank you so much for coming along with me over these last few days cuz it's been a ride it's been a lot but I'm excited right now I'm just more tired but yeah yeah checking with me in the morning yeah"}
