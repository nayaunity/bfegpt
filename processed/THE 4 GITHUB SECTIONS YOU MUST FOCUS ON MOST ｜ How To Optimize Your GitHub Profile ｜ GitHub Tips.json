{"video_title": "THE 4 GITHUB SECTIONS YOU MUST FOCUS ON MOST \uff5c How To Optimize Your GitHub Profile \uff5c GitHub Tips", "transcript": "hello everybody my name is nyan i'm the black female engineer i provide content for new and aspiring software engineers and today we're going to be talking about the best way to optimize your github so that when a recruiter goes on to it when a company goes on to it it is the best it can be it is eye-catching yet really showcases your talent and really shows them that okay this this might be the person we need to call for an interview let's get them in the office and see what they're about so let's get to it so here is the github that will serve as our model for this demonstration we are going to focus on four primary parts we're going to focus on this intro area you see right here we're going to focus on the left of it we're also going to focus on the pinned section and then our contributions area so starting with this right here big text section this is something that i actually did not know was possible until i saw other people's readmes and githubs and i was like oh wow like i want that that's very eye-catching it's really cool and it makes you know github and profiles just more exciting so we want to provide whoever comes onto our github profile with some type of introduction to ourselves let's think about applying to jobs and recruiters going onto our github which many of them do so we want to provide them with a quick introduction and what you focus on in terms of your engineering here i say that my focus is on either front end or full stack development and my projects are reflections of my interests and passions and i like to maintain a sleek modern design despite how you know complicated the apps themselves may be this is very important because yes your resume is there to show your skills and your experiences but it also makes it the recruiter's job to kind of read between the lines and say okay so it looks like their focus is x y and z and you know because this is what they listed their skills and and all that but by you taking this opportunity to in your github and really in all your other profiles linkedin profile and all of that you can say look no reading between the lines like i am the person for front-end engineering this is my focus this is what i do in my free time i am your girl i am your guy i am your person so really just take that opportunity to do that here then i put a little bit of my background into the same section and so here i put that i'm a graduate from a four-year university with a finance and accounting degree and i state a little bit why i switched to software engineering saying that i just wasn't very fulfilled despite my interest in the subject matter and you know after doing this one task of automation for my team i realized i was in the wrong field because it was the best working day ever so that ladies and gents is when i knew i was in the wrong field and now here i am it's okay to be a little bit more casual with this it's okay to you know let your hair down and show these recruiters and other people viewing your page just you know what your personality is like and so that's what i like to do here like emojis and just being you know really kind of animated in some parts but also showing that i am competent and you know would be a great member to their team and then i put a contact me blurb right here saying feel free to contact me via linkedin or email and so before we get to this next section over here let me show you all how to actually add this to your github because that is something that i did not know how to do so we go into repositories click there select new on the right and then with repository name make it whatever your username is and so you see on the left my username is the black female engineer make your repo name the exact same thing copying the casing and everything it has to be an exact match and so well mine already exists because you saw the section already but you see when i do that this little thing pops up that says you found a secret the black female engineer slash the is a special repository that you can use to add a readme to your github profile make sure it's public and initialize it with a readme to get started so we scroll down make sure public is selected and then click add a readme file then after make after you make sure that that is checked then you click create repository i can't because mine is already created but you then create repository so now let's go back to my page and i'm going to show you what it looks like when you create it so when you your repository what will happen is let me click edit you are sent to where you can put in the information want really you can put in images you the texture of the emojis etc you get these large headers by putting three hashtags first and then anything past the hashtags is text or you know just like the regular uh body text but you can also put in images in here and those will show up you can add to the emojis etc and then when you're ready you just say commit directly to the main branch and then commit changes and click that and then you should see it just pop up right front and center on your github profile and so this is just yeah something super fun to add and i don't know it makes me happy maybe i'm just you know a nerd for these kinds of things but it makes me really happy to see so next on the left side of our github is where our more general information um is so let's click edit profile because this is really how all of this happens so if we could click edit profile that is where you can create just a quick little blurb here and so you know software engineer with additional experience in x y and z looking to use my skills in front of development and user focus development then you can put where you are currently working i had just put flat iron school because i was a student of flat iron school they can put your location this is something you can um choose to opt out of to be honest what i've seen um and you know this may be different experiences for different people but what i have seen is certain jobs maybe um putting certain applications to the side because they see that they're in the location where they are not based and they don't want to pay for relocation and so some people will choose to not put their location but i had my location on there you can put your email putting your email is kind of tricky i'll show you that in a second but then you can link anything you want as well you can link your linkedin so you know whatever your linkedin url is so linkedin.com that's the black female engineer that is you know not my linkedin but you can put your linkedin you can also link wherever your portfolio site is you can click link it here or a great idea is to also link it right here because again it's very hard to miss right here then you can also link in a twitter so let me show you how to put in your email oh yeah it was in the settings so if you go to settings so if you click email settings that is where you can add your new email and then once your new email is verified you go in here and select that new verified email i'm not going to click this because it has personal very very personal information but trust me it'll all make sense once you click this button so let's go back to our personal profile so section three the pin section now this is very important the pins section is where we want to put in all of our projects that we want to say yo yo recruiter over there look at these things that i did and so they can see okay project number two front end and then see you know the walkthrough the readme table of contents i always created walkthrough videos for each specific app i created because it's very rare that a person will really take the time to parse through all code but instead will watch a video of what you created and so this is how all of my apps look in their readme and so i pinned all the apps i wanted them to really focus on here um or not really not the apps but the repos and so each app is like a row because i had the front end of the back end in two different repos all the time it's just very important to have a separation of concern that way and so not having your front end back end in the same exact app or same exact repo is very important now the front and back and front and back and front end back end that is how i worked so how do we do this we click customize your pins so if you click customize your pins you get access to every single one of your repos and so you can only pick six yes that's up to six public repositories and so click on those the ones you want it doesn't have to be six it can be two it can be one i like to aim for at least three but you know if you're new you don't don't be out here putting repos to terrible projects just because you're trying to add more things just wait you know be patient and you'll get to that number that you want so then after you finish you know selecting everything and whatnot click save pins and then they would show up in the pin section you can then move them the way you want and so i like things to be easy to follow and so i liked all the front end stuff being in one section and then all the back and stuff being in the other section and making each row its own project so that's the way i decided to go at it now finally the contributions now no one dragged me okay like i got a job like right around here and so i kind of fell off in my personal github um commits but while i was you know in school and looking for a job i really really tried to make sure i kept things um as green as possible making sure i at least coded or at least committed once every like two days but of course you know sometimes long weekends would happen and you know you know things things happen but but yes trying to make sure that whoever comes to my github sees that i am serious about this that i am not just doing this for kicks and for giggles but i'm doing this to actually make a true career shift and be a true engineer so if you see everything from you know may back i did not know github even existed i did not know what it was i had no idea but that is um in this period when i started to learn to code and then really started making sure all of my projects were being pushed up to github to really make sure that my activity was being stored because even in this may section i was still producing projects i was still coding but i didn't know the importance of tracking that activity and that progress through github and so or some type of version control app and so that is why there's really nothing from here on back but yes started school and then really started making sure i was committing every day and so that is very very important because you can say in your interview that hey i have a true passion for coding and i code all the time but then if this you know recruiter pulls up this your github and sees this section right here but that is all your sections like something's not adding up that is not okay and you want to really make sure that you are given you are giving these recruiters and these companies every reason to believe what you are saying and every reason to trust that you're a passionate and trust that you are determined and show them that you are the person to hire so there we have it everybody my tips as to how to best optimize your github specifically while you're onto the job hunt so you can really just increase your odds of getting that phone call that you got the job or you know at least you know a phone call for a round one interview if you'd like me to get more in depth into the readme or anything like that please let me know in the comments i like to make sure i'm tailoring my content to something that you all want to see so please let me know but thank you so much everybody and i'll see y'all later bye y'all"}
