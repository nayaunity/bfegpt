{"video_title": "GET A JOB AFTER CODING BOOTCAMP \uff5c How To Ensure Success After Coding Bootcamp", "transcript": "hi everybody my name is naya and i'm the black female engineer and i'm so happy to see you because today i'm going to be talking about the five key things i did that allowed me to get overall three job offers within a month of graduating coding boot camp one of those job offers happening three hours after i had graduated which to this day is just so mind-boggling to me and so when i look back there are some very key things i did that may have been different from my peers that really allowed me to have such amazing success so quickly number one i tailored each of my portfolio projects to something i would be proud talking about during an interview or to an employer or putting on my resume so encoding bootcamp along with if you're self-teaching or you're in college or anything like that you will create projects for your portfolio you will create apps whether they be web-based apps or mobile apps or a mission a mix between the two or anything like that you'll create apps with the hope of including them within your portfolio for simply practice now what i did is i really looked at what things interest me the most and things i could create that i actually would be like look look what i did either because of the styling either because of the features i included within that app i really made myself think what is something that would really differentiate myself within that application process and so what i ended up doing was creating three main web apps one was an ingredient to recipe app called mints the second was a budgeting app and then the third was a social justice app however don't just think okay what will impress x y and z company what will impress or make my resume look all you know cool and all that think about the things you're actually interested in so me i really like to cook i like making new recipes meal prepping all that and so that's what drove the creation of my first web app the second the financial budgeting app i come from finance and accounting that is my background and so knowing that and then me being in my early 20s i know that i can you know go off the rules when it comes to my spending habits and things like that and so i created an app tailored to that and then the third i'm very passionate about social justice and like to think of ways i can be of help whenever um i can and so create an app to assist in that so i'm not saying just think about oh i think it'll be really cool if you know like no think about things you're really interested in so let's say you're really interested in birds so there's actually a story that was shared with us during coding boot camp where somebody was really interested in birds they created kind of a shazam type app for bird sounds so you hear the sound of a bird and you could put up your phone and shazam it and that would in turn provide you the type of bird that is making that sound and so like that's so so interesting and so cool and so i'm not saying you know think about you know the stock market or think about you know economic no like think about things that are interesting to you and to create an app that really ties in that interest and build your features and the styling and the all those stuff on something that an intern would be impressive to share with others number two the next thing i did was i started applying to jobs two months before i was set to even graduate from the coding boot camp so i it is very important that you listen to this do not apply to your holy grail of a job do not apply to your dream job at this time don't apply don't be applying to you know google twitter you know all the jazz just yet because when you're applying to jobs in this period again about two months before i graduate coding boot camp or before you graduate your self-teaching schedule college etc apply to the jobs and positions that you wouldn't really cry yourself to sleep at night for not getting the goal with this is to really allow for that practice and get in the groove of setting out resumes and in turn interviewing so because the first jobs you would have applied to are the ones that aren't your dream job now ideally those are the jobs that would contact you first for an interview now you're interviewing with them treat it as more of a practice run so i'm not saying you know go in there with your loose shirt and you're you know popping the hoodie popping the collar like no i'm not saying do any of that what i'm saying though is because this isn't a job that you've been dreaming all your life of having now you can one approach the interviews with a bit more ease and with a more relaxed persona and you get to iron up the kinks that you didn't even know you had so before going to an interview yes you're going to practice questions the coding part portions of the interviews and the tech challenges and things like that but when you're in there and when you're talking about your projects and your previous experience and your five strengths and weaknesses you're going to realize certain kinks you have in your story whether it be that you really don't know your project as well as you thought you did or you really can't really share with the person on the other side of the table the magnitude of a certain strength or weakness or et cetera because now you're really in that hot seat now you're getting feedback from that employer that your mama couldn't give you that you know your brother your girlfriend like they couldn't give you because one they love you and two they're not trained unless you know they're hr or some ish but they're not trained to look out for certain buzzwords or certain body language or things like that because they're not trained to do that it's going to be the interviewer's feedback that's really going to create those moments of oh wow i did not realize i even sound like that or even you know talk like that or things like that that is why i recommend applying to jobs two months before your graduation to allow for that practice that way when it is time where you are applying to your google and your twitter and your facebook when you're applying to those jobs you are now more relaxed knowing really what your capabilities are what your real strengths are in interviews and what to look out for so that is tip number two now tip number three whenever you see a job you're interested in go on linkedin if you don't have a linkedin create one please please please create look on linkedin and see who is employed or has been employed by that same company and try to get connected with them when i say try to get connected i don't mean just you know click the request button and then go along your merry day no that is not what i mean what i mean is reach out to them first with a short message blurb attached to that request so something like hi my name is maya i am really interested in this job and this position and saw that you were recently employed as this or that is your current role i would love to speak with you about the insights you have from being involved in this company your life dislikes etc that is how you should connect with them include those blurbs sharing that you're not just looking for you know a plus one in your connection list you're looking for actual true insight and knowledge into the company into the role into the position by doing this you're a lot more likely to one get that request approved by that person and two now you'll have a connection in the job you want does that make sense now whenever you post something on linkedin whenever you share x y and z that person and the role you want in the company you want will see it and what they do with that information that is up to them i'm not i i don't know but that is putting so much closer to that end goal of getting employed than not doing that and that actually brings us to tip four whenever you complete a project build a new web app create an article about something you've learned post it on linkedin please please post it because now with this new connection list of people who actually are in the roles and positions of jobs you want to be in now when you share hey i just did x y z project i just created this app they not only see that okay you're actually dedicated to this career switch but they have the power to say to xy recruiter or xy manager like oh did this person apply yeah i actually saw that they did x y and z i think you know i'm really interested in them i think you should be too and see where that takes you and not only that a lot of times i've been in situations where the person i have reached out to actually ends up being my interviewer or part of the interview process because it's not just the hr team that's doing interviews it's the recruiter and hr team but it's also members of the direct teams you would be working on because it's not only important that the hr is not only oh and i did it again okay it's not only important that the hr and recruiting team likes you but it's important for your potential manager for your potential co-workers to like youtube because at the end of the day once that hr hires you you know in some companies like it's wraps this dude's like they're out but it's the managers and the co-workers that are sticking with that are stuck with you so you know i'm but i'm sure you're a very lovely person you're a great team member so don't um don't put any negative connotation around that but please after you gain those linkedin connections and really start uploading your progress and your projects and the apps and honestly bonus points if you can actually also upload a walkthrough video of you using your apps on linkedin as well because a lot of times if you say oh just go here and you'll see my app or if the app isn't you know isn't available for the public and you just say oh i created this and then period then it's like well okay like i guess i'll take your word for it but it's really nice getting to actually see what that walkthrough is like so upload a walkthrough video with it as well and y'all tip number five i really think this is really really what allowed me to get the jobs i did in the time i did and that is think about your competitive advantage when it comes to the job process and lean into that so what do i mean by this when i started learning how to code that was in june of 2020 i had just graduated from college with a degree in accounting finance but that's i had just graduated from college in may of 2020 so just one month before now when it comes to college recruiting that a lot of times is a whole different process than recruiting as a full-on professional um who's been doing this for five years three years ten years et cetera when your college when you're recruiting out of college there are portals that you have access to that other people don't because there are because companies are posting jobs solely wanting to graduate either a college graduate or someone who is about to graduate college so i say all of this because i had already graduated college however i still had access to these portals and to the jobs that were looking for college graduates and people who were about to graduate college actually the job i ended up signing on was a job that work looking for current college students which i no longer was but because i was in that one year threshold i still qualified and i ended up getting that type of role so my competitive advantage was the fact that i had just graduated from college and had access to these portals now my peers did not have access to these portals when you're graduate coding boot camp now the jobs you are looking at are the same jobs that your peers are looking at do you see where i'm going with this they're the same jobs your peers are looking at and they may end up being the same jobs your peers are applying to and when you're being interviewed you may be interviewed at you know two o'clock and then your peers being interviewed at 2 30. so it is so essential to think about spaces you occupy that your peers don't so i don't want you to say like okay wait but i'm 35 years old and i you know graduated 15 years like i i don't what there's nothing for me there no so you are transitioning into software engineering that's amazing one congrats two where are you transitioning from for me that was that was accounting and finance i would recommend looking at accounting and financial firms and seeing what tech related jobs they are posting so okay you worked at bank of america look to see if bank of america is posting roles for software engineers you are now a software engineer about to be a software engineer and you have all this experience and education related to the financial field now can all your other classmates say the same likely not so think about that think about where your background is in and really steer into that during your job hunt process now okay let's say you haven't had a job and you know you're a working professional so you're not just graduating from college etc now what do you do if you remember i talked about the app the person who was really interested in birds built that in itself could be a competitive advantage so you're really into birds now you have created three portfolio projects to really aid the bird community to really set yourself apart and because of your bird passion and things like that apply to roles that would really appreciate that now i don't know jack squat about birds so i really can to think of a company maybe like the national wildlife preserve or the national association of bird watching or like things like that think about roles and companies that would appreciate this passion of yours and apply to those because while other people may be applying out of just you know generic job hunt looking stuff you're applying because you have this deep passion that's been proven because of your portfolio projects and things like that and so again this comes down to thinking about your competitive advantage and what sets you apart from beth kathy tom chad all of them over here where is the space that you can occupy that none of them can now just a little asterisk over here don't only apply to those rules i'm not saying just toss those other positions into the trash and don't even bother with those i'm not saying that still apply to the roles that you see pop up on linkedin the ones that you see on you know google when you search software engineering roles near me and things like that still apply to those i did but focus less on those and i'd say at least 60 to the jobs that are more your competitive advantage type of jobs because even though i still applied to jobs that were popping up on linkedin popping up on google i applied to a total of i want to say upwards 60 jobs in my job hunt process but do you want to know which jobs i got interviewed for 85 percent were the jobs that were in my niche so think about that so thank you so so much for joining me today i'll be talking next about the resume that got me my dream job please let me know your thoughts on this video the tips and really any other questions that you'd really like me to go into my next videos because at the end of the day this is for you so i want to make sure i'm being useful so thank you so much for watching this and getting through this with me and i look forward to seeing you soon"}
