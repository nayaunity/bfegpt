{"video_title": "REACTING TO NIGHTMARE WORK SITUATIONS FROM FISHBOWL! Unpacking the Worst Work Situations With Advice", "transcript": "I hope you're having a fantastic day my name is Nia and I'm the black female engineer and today we're going to fill some things that some of yall are going through at work I'm going to go through the Fishbowl app this is not sponsored for those who don't know Fishbowl is an app where people in the workplace can go in and just like vent and also seek advice it's really great for things like salary transparency let's say if you got an offer for a certain company you can go on there it's all Anonymous go on there and say like hey this is my offer offer is the role um do y'all think it's a good deal what are y'all being paid if you're in this company things like that kind of like glass door but like a lot more interaction and sometimes a lot more like unhinged so yeah we're going to have fun let's just let's go into it okay first up let's see should I give two weeks notice or leave immediately my manager is being extremely problematic intentionally difficult and has been treating me very badly well mocked in our morning standups HR won't do anything upper management has condemned this behavior and vowed to correct the situation but nothing has changed in about two months because of this I don't see any future here and have landed another R okay that's amazing is there any point in giving the standard two we notice not going to lie to y'all I've never given a two week notice I don't see the point in me being courteous to you when you were unkind to me like this person is saying that yeah you are just being unkind her manager just being unkind and just mistreating her and so I don't know that's me I understand the implications not giving a two week notice can create but also at the same time like this person has already gotten another job it's not like they give you an offer and now they're going to call up your old job for a referral you know what I mean so I say leave it let's say you get in trouble for breaking policy and then report others for breaking the same policy under the GU of maintaining the the policy amongst everyone bro if you get fired after that is that retaliation for you complaining or can employers not get in trouble I'm sorry I think one that's so frustrating when so many people are doing this thing and you were the only one reprimanded it's like no I'm bringing everyone in their mama down with me like we're not playing that but the thing is you're not saying that you didn't break a certain policy like you're saying like you did and you were represented but you're upset that other people weren't which is extremely valid that being said they are entitled to fire you for breaking the policy you know but just suck that like yeah you're the only one getting in trouble oh this is interesting I just started a new company and I'm getting chased by a project manager she's talking as if I've been here for a while and I know everything she's trying to intimidate and challenge me I'm a new hire and I feel really scared on how to talk to her can someone help it's too early for alcoh that sucks like especially as a new hire you're trying so hard to put on the best face and give your best work but then it's like I can only give my best work if I feel supported and if I'm getting support in this role and so I would go to your project manager um it doesn't have to be like a formal thing but I presume because you're a new hire you do have touch points with your project manager one on one and so when you are given a new task ask the questions I say there's a solid six month months where you can ask any question at that you want there's no stupid question in the first six months especially because after the six months if you ask a stupid question now it's like what what were you doing the last six months like were you just faking something like that's not good luck and if you ask these questions and they make you feel stupid for that that shows a lot about their culture and that's not on you at the end of the day always reinforce like I am just trying to do a good job and I want to provide a great output for you all and so for me to do that I will need information on this this and this and answering these questions will be very helpful to me and just keep on reiterating that I hold the belief that you can kind of say anything you want to people as long as it's said in the right way and so if you're a person that's like yo I'm feeling chased by this person she's not helping me or anything say like okay great where can I go for proper assistance if you're too busy where can I go for proper assistance on this and keep it moving that sucks that really especially as hire that sucks next up how do you deal with someone that is impossible to work with this person is unnecessarily nasty condesending enjoys publicly pointing out and calling out what everyone else did wrong even if inaccurate yet takes zero accountability for their own actions and mistakes I haven't met a cooworker that likes this person for the record it is known a known fact that they are not very good at their job I have honestly never encountered someone this awful to work with before that's sucks honestly so let's say we're in a meeting and this person's like oh yeah no um Nia did this is this wrong and it was so terrible and they're throwing me under the bus like that I would and and the only reason I say I'm going to say it like this is because they themselves are apparently being like nasty and cold in the way they're talking to you even in front of people from what I gather I would say okay Nancy I appreciate your attempt to provide feedback however the way in which you're doing it is extremely unproductive and does not does not contribute to a professional work environment so instead I ask that you come to me if you have any recommendations of how someone could do this or how I could have done a better job in a manner that is respectful and professional I would say that you can say anything in this world in my opinion almost anything you just need to know the proper to say it and by me calling out how unproductive they are communicating is like the way they communicate is like everyone is going to understand what I'm talking about and also give me kudos for saying like no like good job standing up for yourself that's not okay that she's doing that like if you're being unprofessional to me and everyone's seeing it I'm going to be professional in my uh pointing out of that you know does that make sense I know it can be like scary especially if you're a person who doesn't like confrontation but you know what I also don't like being called out in front of everybody and their mama like I'm not playing that game I've been overqualified for some positions I've interviewed for can someone plead explain the logic if I'm willing to work in an underqualified role so I used to be that person who didn't understand why being overqualified made me not get a job that was until I got a job I was overqualified for and I quit on the third day didn't even show up I said I'm sorry I'm on my way to work um this was not like a huge job it was like a job at an ice cream parlor I was in college um it was like a summer job and everything but at that point I had gotten a couple of internships and things like that and I was just like I had like I had attempted to get the I had wanted the job for like extra money but then I got there and I was like no I see what being overqualified means this is mind- numbingly not a good time and so literally on my way to work I I said like I've never given a two weeks notice um I called and I was like I am sorry I can't do this it is I I cannot attend also know that the people I was around it was it was rough there were things in the offices that shouldn't be in the offices that were not necessarily legal to be in the offices because of these other co-workers like things like that and so I was like no I am out I am not associating myself with this like goodbye however from that point on I did understand the issue of being overqualified if you're overqualified for something at least this is the case for me it is so hard to be engaged I have never had so little brain cells working um while I'm at work that that was a new experience for me um and I couldn't do it again I was just so not engaged another issue is yes of course all of us we work for money like let's not pretend that I am here filling out this paperwork because I love this pen like that's not what we're here for I'm here because you pay me money and you got me here because I can provide an output for you however there is an issue that comes with not being able to like teach a person something if I'm an employer and I can't teach a person anything or provide them ways to grow as a professional because they were already overal qualified when they got here that create that does create an issue on the working relationship and I get that it sucks like believe especially in this economy it sucks not getting a job because you're overqualified but with your question of can someone explain it to me that's my explanation ooh this is a fun one share your weirdest interview moments that's the that's the initial post and people are going to respond to it with theirs in at a very small Tech contracting company in the early 2000s in DC with the CTO and sales guy sales guy is as young as me ask what bars I like to go to I throw out a few he replied I like 1583 the club used Roman numerals as its sign my eyes were bold the best trip Club in the best trip Club in town is that number I terar out of reply I've been there but I like this other strip club better hey Chuckles sorry you're confusing 1583 with 1782 1583 is down the street from 1782 away from Midtown not on it it's new I choke he laughs a little then says yeah we hit 1782 on Thursday nights after bouncing around that broke the ice and I felt better got the job so yes I've talked about strip clubs in an interview actually a nice place to work and everyone was nice A little odd but nice I would be horrified especially because like you started talking about strip clubs because they started talking about strip clubs and you're not you're trying to like keep up with the conversation that's hilarious I'm glad that person shared that that's very very very funny do y'all have a weird interview experience let me know if you do I have um not a weird interview experience but it was a rough
