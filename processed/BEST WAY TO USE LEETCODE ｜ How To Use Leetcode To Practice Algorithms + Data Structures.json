{"video_title": "BEST WAY TO USE LEETCODE \uff5c How To Use Leetcode To Practice Algorithms + Data Structures", "transcript": "hello everybody my name is nya and i'm the black female engineer i provide content for new and aspiring software engineers and today we are going over lead code how to use it how to use it effectively and how to really prepare for the technical interview with this resource this is what i used when preparing for technical interviews and i highly recommend it so let's get to it so right away after you create an account you're taken to this like news feed page i highly recommend creating an account because that's how you'll see your progress you'll see all the challenges you've done before all your saved work and all of that it's really going to allow you to get the most out of this we're going to focus on these three main pages explore problems and mock so starting off with explore you're kind of taken to this choose your own adventure type page where you can pick to practice based on a certain coding challenge or based on a topic or based on interviews a company you're interviewing for and so that first banner is really a mix of all of those but scrolling down a little bit this is where we see that section for interviews so we have google facebook amazon apple and you see here it's all for premium members and so you'll need to pay for lead code to access these things and so if you are interviewing for places like microsoft like facebook and you're new to development or you're new to interviewing then i can see the benefit of going distraught and getting that premium membership but if you're not then i kind of truly think you can get away with not going these routes unless you're specifically interviewing for facebook etc and i say that because i didn't have a premium membership but i still had access to all of these amazing resources and so moving on to the learn section you can choose coding challenges your path based on the specific subject and so if you want to learn about linked lists or binary trees or recursion this is where you can do that really focusing your learning on the specific subject or maybe in general you just don't know much about binary trees or you don't know much about the recursion this is a great way to learn that and test your skills there this is also great if you know a company is going to test recursion going to test or raise going to test linked lists and so that is another way you can go about studying and then finally we have the challenge section and this is great if you have trouble staying consistent and you need that extra push to be consistent to be on it and so with the challenge you have you know january leeco challenge december etc so that you can make sure that you're following along with this material and staying on top of it because consistency really is key here now going up to really where i lived um for a couple of months and that's the problems section so the problem section is real exactly what that is just a bunch of problems each of them one single and if you see here they're really sectioned out by acceptance difficulty and so you can choose a problem based on those things so the acceptance kind of indirectly tells you the complexity of the problem it says of all the people who submitted problems who submitted solutions only 46.7 were accepted by leak code which means there's a whole 53 percent that weren't accepted so it can be a good gauge for complexity and so i typically always sorted by difficulty and then clicked on acceptance so that it was from highest to lowest because it could be easy but then it can still be complicated and so this is how i would go through the problems and if you see there's loads and loads of problems to go through here which is why i say you don't really need the premium subscription and so this first one has a 95.6 acceptance rate which can really tell you that is probably the easiest problem you'll find and this one's locked because you need to be a premium member and so all the ones you see that have that lock symbol you need to be a premium member but look at all the ones that don't have that locked symbol you truly don't need that subscription to get the most out of your experience so let's start with this problem number of good pairs and so this is our interface this is how each problem will be presented to us with the name of the problem along with the description and then the example so here we say given an array of integers nums a pair i j is called good if nums i equals nums j and i is less than j return the number of good pairs and so then if we go down we see examples and constraints and i really love this interface because from my experience this is kind of always how coding challenges were presented to me they had this entire layout of the description and then examples and then a space to input your solution and so it was great practice in terms of actually getting that real world experience so that i wouldn't be caught off guard when it was time to interview and even when it was a one-on-one interview the person was actually there there still would be this interface provided so that everything was clear and all of that so this is great and then here you can input your solutions or test out solutions and all of that now first thing you'll want to do here is check the coding language and so for me this is total gibberish i really cannot read this and so i'm going to change it to javascript that's where that's typically the coding language i use now keep in mind make sure you're paying attention to the type of interview you have received if you're interviewing for front end role it's probably not the best idea to be coding out in c plus plus because front end is javascript and so keep that in mind when you're practicing if you're interviewing for both back and front end roles then you should be switching around and making sure you can answer the questions um in all the different types of languages and typically you are given the option to choose your language but it also says a lot the language you choose so we're not actually going to solve this we're going to go into discuss which i also lived here because it's great for seeing how other people solved this problem if you're stuck if you're not sure what to do or even if you solved it but you're looking at ways it could have been better this is a great thing to do and so if you pick the language you're working in me it's javascript look at how many solutions are posted up by users and there's seven whole pages and there's just so much and so let's start off by picking one to look at so let's see here let's do just the first one so we see the solution that this person put up we see that okay there's a let there's a for loop then another for loop and then he returns count so this is a great way to kind of see how other people interpreted the problem see if you understand the solution that they provided and if you're stuck it's a great way to get unstuck because you see oh okay i understand for loops and they did this then they went for the nums length then they incremented count by one if i equal j and it's just a great way to kind of go through that solution to kind of go that problem solving seeing okay i get it now so let me wipe the solution out let me exit out of this and try it myself without looking at this and can i make it make sense for me now if we go to other solutions okay so we see here this is a lot this is very different from the first one now this is where you can get into trouble don't try to find the most fancy solution find the thing that looks most impressive let's say you don't know what a for each is you don't know what dot set does etc that can get you into trouble if you're just copying the solution and pasting that's not gonna help you during the interview what you could do is use your confusion to say okay let me google what 4-h is let me google what dot set is and learn how this solution came together but yeah going through the different solutions going through the more complicated ones the simpler ones etc it's a great way for you to learn from the people around you because on the job that's what you should be doing to strive to be learning from people strive to be doing better because you see someone else's process somebody else's code but again don't be copy and pasting this and calling it good without knowing any which way what's going on and so let's exit out of this and try to find yeah a solution that works for us so we go back to discuss my bed there we go back and let's try to select that first problem again i think it's a great beginner friendly solution let's copy this and paste i definitely don't recommend copying pasting even if you find a solution that you resonate with i recommend typing it out because that's the best way you'll learn but for the sake of this tutorial we'll copy and paste it and then we'll go down here and select run code which puts the solution through one of leak codes tests and if we click submit it will go through all of their tests and see if it passes all of them and it does and we see here it gives us information as to the runtime and memory usage so runtime it says it was five percent faster than other submissions which is not the best that is not that is not good but the memory usage is less than 91 now focusing on that runtime the 5.07 percent it's very important to see why that is and to see ways to make it better and then for memory usage 91.08 that's pretty good so we can focus our efforts into that runtime and in interviews that's really where our focus will be trying to see how to make good quality code that runs quickly because that's important for our users or our hypothetical users if we get the job so if we look here at the solution we can see this embedded for loop here now that is a huge no-no that is a huge no-no because it produces if you've heard of time space complexity this produces a time complexity of o of n squared because of this embedded for loop and that's something you would be expected to talk about in an interview in interviews i've never really been expected to talk about space complexity but time complexity oh you must much at least touch on and so if you have a solution that's of n squared it's very important to find ways to make it less than that and that's another reason why this discussion board can be so so useful finding solutions that are faster than this 5.07 percent or this of n squared solution and so but keep in mind if this is your very first problem honestly this is great the fact that you got to a solution is fantastic and so this the time space complexity piece can be something you focus on later right now your focus can be really just solving problems and figuring out ways to solve it and all of that and then getting to that added layer later on and so going back to the problems page and if we re organize the difficulty of easy and if we scroll down we can now see a check mark for that problem saying good job we solved it one of problems we're making our way making our way downtown y'all but yes there's just so many problems we can go through and so that's why i say yeah if you are just consistent and you're going through you'll be good you don't need that premium membership but then going to mock this provides mock interview questions from quo unquote real companies and this can be great if you are interviewing for a specific top-tier company like facebook amazon microsoft but again you will need that premium subscription and so yeah for me it's only that premium subscription is only worth it if that is your situation if that is the circumstances in which you are in but then you do have a few random ones here but yeah i typically just live in the problem section y'all like i truly just was very consistent made goals of let's do three a day or let's do ten a week the number you put as to how many you want to solve really just depends on your goals your timeline when you'll get your interviews when you're looking to start interviewing and so really see what that timeline looks like and sit down and go through that but yeah that's really it y'all let's log out here i created a separate account for this to really show a beginner experience is like but there we go there we go everybody a detailed look into how to best use leak code i hope this was helpful if it was please leave a like subscribe and i'll see y'all later bye"}
