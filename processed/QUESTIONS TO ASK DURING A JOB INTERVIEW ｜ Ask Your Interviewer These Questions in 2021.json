{"video_title": "QUESTIONS TO ASK DURING A JOB INTERVIEW \uff5c Ask Your Interviewer These Questions in 2021", "transcript": "hello everybody my name is nyan i'm the black female engineer i provide content for new and aspiring software engineers and today we're talking about the questions to ask during a job interview when they say do you have any questions you should pull out that scroll and be like yes actually if you have 20 minutes um and go into it and so these are the five questions to ask number one this is very 2021 specific but how has the pandemic affected this company's operations and this specific role one they can say oh actually really the biggest effect was that it had to be online now but it can also be that they now had to switch a lot of things up if their business had to do a lot with in-person interaction let's say you work for a theme park and you're trying to be a developer there now the pandemic very much could have affected them and their day-to-day operations and really just everyone from the top to the bottom this is also a great question to understand how the company deals with unexpected change and extremely high stress situations which is really funny because that's a lot of times what they want to know from you so we're in a very rare opportunity where we can ask direct questions to get a sense of how they deal with that as well because if you find out that they fired 50 of the people and now they're over here trying to hire you meanwhile jenny over here is still without a job that there's something wrong there you know what i mean and so it's a great way to just see how the company reacts to yeah change and any unexpected things that your role now has that maybe the person behind you the person before you did not have to go through number two what will the first 90 days in this role look like for me this is great for you to just lay down the scene of understanding what to expect me i get very flustered and anxious with the not knowing with every day being like hey when am i supposed to do x y and z or am i supposed to know this by now do they expect me to be building all of this right now and this is a great way for you to kind of hold them accountable later on and say well you actually told me the first three months here would look like x y and z and so that's what i'm trying to make sure i provide for you all this also provides you with the opportunity to say what you as a worker kind of needs as support from them are you the type of person who likes to have you know your direct manager on standby so you can ask questions are there channels for mentorship are there channels for me to ask you know a buddy can i have a buddy that i can ask these little questions to like where's the kitchen where's the copier things like that or is it going to be very solo do you like working solo saying something like oh well in the first 90 days i really like to focus on my job description really understanding the lay of the land really observing everybody else and how they do things and so please don't be alarmed if i you don't hear from me much it doesn't mean i'm not working or doesn't mean i'm struggling it really means that i'm trying to just take everything in as much as possible so it's a two-way street of understanding what they would expect from you but you providing what you would need as support and what they can expect of you too that way when if and when the first 90 days comes for you both of you just have a better idea of how you operate number three what aspects of the company culture would you like to be developed this is great because companies like to toot from their horn up on the rooftop up on the mountains talking about how great their company is and i'm not saying they're lying but sometimes it takes that extra push extra question of saying yo actually but what's wrong with this company because there's always something wrong in a company it doesn't mean it's a bad company or be a bad place to work with but you still need to know those things so you can better prepare yourself so that you can also make more informed decisions of do i actually want to work here or not and so saying yeah what parts of the culture would you like to be developed it's really code for yeah what's wrong here like tell me what what do i need to know and so this is a great way for them to see that okay you actually care about the other things surrounding your work not just the job description not just you know the the technical things but the actual vibe of this workspace and it forces them to actually be honest with you and tell you what that is something i like to do is once they provide their answer i like to ask them what efforts they're putting in place to get that done because if they say oh well this sucks but we just deal with it i don't like it and so i like to just to follow it up with oh that's really interesting for you to say are there or what are the steps being taken to remedy those issues and that really makes them be held accountable for the workspace and yeah what's going on there so it's a great two-parter number four this kind of goes with number two and that is what do you anticipate will be the most difficult part about my transition it kind of goes to number two of describing my first 90 days and now yeah what do you anticipate will be the most challenging thing for me and this is great again for preparing you especially if they say oh we think you learning c plus is going to be the most difficult part then you can spend the next you know week or two before you even start your job to learn and whatnot and just have a nice smoother transition into it all and this is also great when they check up on you once you start working and let's say you've been working for a few weeks and you're really having trouble learning c plus it's really great to know that they know that it was going to be a struggle does that make sense sometimes what's difficult for me is feeling like shoot i don't want to say i'm having issues because they expect me to know this and they expect me to be all up in here and all of this and so i don't want to show any type of weakness or show x y and z so now that you know that they know that this is a struggle you're less scared to bring it up once you start working actually yeah you're right this is a struggle um are there any extra resources or even bringing up in meetings and things like that because they are the first ones to have admitted that it would have been difficult for you and then last but not least number five is there anything about my resume or about our conversation here today that gives you any type of pause or concern i love this question because if there isn't it's a opportunity for them to praise you it's a great way to kind of gauge how they're feeling about you they can either say no we think you are a great match we've loved talking with you your your values are very much aligned with ours and we look forward to talking with you you can now kind of leave that interview with a sense of like okay so i think i'm okay i think i'll be good and just be a little bit less nervous or they can say actually we don't like that you've only been working for a year and this job requires two to three years of experience then it gives you the opportunity to address these concerns and say yes i completely understand why that would give you pause however i just wanted noted that although i've only been working for a year these are all the things i was able to do in that short amount of time that i saw on your job description you expected somebody to do in two to three years and so i hope that helps mitigate any concerns you have so so it creates a great opportunity to just be like i understand that that's an issue but here's why it shouldn't be or but this is why it actually should be a positive for you like it shows that i'm a quick learner i'm driven and hardworking and all of these things and so they can either like i said give you praise or give you an opportunity to address any concerns they have instead of you just leaving and they are in their mind like oh she only has a year of experience now it's oh yeah she actually is right she learned really quickly and she was able to build all this and contribute in all of these ways that's amazing and so this thing that was once a con for them is now this amazing pro and so there we have it y'all please subscribe please like and comment if you like this video it really helps my channel
