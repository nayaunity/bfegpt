this may not be the place for you [Music] hello everybody my name is nyan i'm the black female engineer i provide content for new and aspiring software engineers and today we're talking about my first month in los angeles so i moved to la uh july ish plus or minus a day and a half so i moved yeah pretty much exactly a month ago i moved from the midwest however i've kind of grown up in many different locations i spent my childhood in new york city then spent my adolescence to early adulthood in the midwest and then i have had a few months where i've lived again in new york city and whatnot and so i've had different experiences with yeah city versus suburban versus xyz and la is very much a place where you can have either and they can be very very opposite from one another and so i live in downtown los angeles like right in the smack bat of downtown and oh okay i'm going to break this reflection up into multiple different buckets i'll go into first impression slash observations go into people go into dating and dating life here and just general activities and vibes and all of that and so one of the very first observations i made here is it's not very crowded here when i think of downtown or when i thought of downtown la i kind of thought of like new york manhattan-ish but obviously not as large but that kind of population may be cut in half but it's not even like .01 of that i don't know if this is because of the parent-teacher conference that's been going on for the last 2000 years or if this is just the norm i think that's also something i'll say a lot that i don't know if this is the panda bear or if it's just the norm and so yeah there's really not many people around walking around and i don't have a car here yet i haven't shipped my car over and so i've been walking a lot here so i feel like i've gotten to experience a lot of downtown from morning to afternoon tonight from weekdays to weekends oh my gosh i just had the biggest coughing fit so if you see me cry mind your business but yeah from weekdays to week ends i've really just explored and seen a lot of what there is to see i feel like and yeah there's not really many people around if there are people everyone really just minds their own business which is very different from new york because people in new york are all up in your business like they are physically just all up in here or just in terms of wording and all of these things they're very vocal but no people here are very much mind your own business and carry on and so i really do appreciate that but if you're thinking about moving to downtown l.a versus another place what i will say off the bat is if you like nature if you like grass and fresh air this may not be the place for you wish and it sounds so obvious but i wish someone had said this to me because i do like fresh air i do love walks in the park in my last apartment before i moved i would take every single day take two hours to walk at this large huge park and lake just two blocks away from me and that would be the best thing of the best part of my day i didn't realize how much i would miss that because i knew i appreciated that because again it would be my favorite part of the day but i didn't know how much not having that would affect me basically and it's fine there's no park really but not even fresh air or anything that's i it's things you don't really think about at least okay i didn't think about it when i was making the decision to move and so i'm like huh okay okay so new smells we're gonna have to get accustomed to that that and also like the parks i was like okay now that has to be a park around here and so i looked on google maps and i was like oh there's a park just like a few blocks away walk there it is pretty much all concrete all concrete it was a concrete park i was like okay y'all this is not a park this is a i don't even know a concert hall this is a monumental site this is i don't know this is not a park and so that was very disappointing but at least i got to stretch my legs and have a walk in general but anyway yes if you appreciate nature without having to take an excursion out of where you live to experience it this may not be the place for you but if you don't mind taking you know a drive to griffith park or to glendale or to santa monica then okay like this you will be fine here probably because yeah you don't mind taking that extra step to get those things i'm gonna make sure to get my car here in the next like month-ish so that i can take those excursions and have you know weekends there that way when it's time for work and it's the week days i don't feel like i'm missing anything because i'm tired from work anyway so don't want to take excursions anyway so that's observations from locations and whatnot now going on to the people i think everyone watching this has a pretty what's the word everyone kind of knows what people say about la people yes i think i said that correctly everyone kind of has an idea or like of the stereotype of la people what i'll say to that what i'll say to that as it says right now you are not wrong so you're not right but you're not wrong there is tons of that here tons of the uh social light people wanting you know the followers for the gram for the tick tock their foodie blogs over here and whatnot like i had to tell someone like hey are we are you gonna eat anytime soon because the first i swear like five minutes when the food came out it was snapping and instagraming and tick-tocking and here i am just trying to eat my spaghetti and i'm like i'm eating alone now i'm pretty much eating alone like come on put your phone away and i actually said that i was like hey yo like come on and so yeah they put their phone away and it was all good but that's kind of the vibe and i think it's also just the times that's what people do especially with this parent-teacher conference outside where it's like shoot the best way for me to connect with other people right now is online and so i think there's a lot of factors going into that but yes i have had to be like that's not i feel like there's less of that in downtown i feel like the people here are very much more chill like very down to earth chill kind of thinking of like yeah new york type of people where like like let me think what i don't i don't remember the um burrows enough for me to really break it down to one type of burrow maybe like the gentrified bronx yeah maybe like the gentrified bronx where everyone's really just chill it's not as much of a social light scene i think it's partly because downtown is less of the pretty and like you know glistening spots of los angeles for the glistening things you go to west hollywood you go to beverly hills you'd go to santa monica and so that's really where you'll see more of that but like downtown that there's it's not as much like that and so those people don't come here so i think yeah if you are more chill and relaxed and you want more down to earth type of people and that earn more experiences then downtown very much might be the place for you now going into dating before i go into it let me just preface by saying i don't really think i am the best person to ask about this because i don't really put myself out there i like y'all i am stressed i just started a new job i am new here like i am very overwhelmed and so yeah putting time to now do all of that doesn't sound like a good time to me but of the three minutes i spent in that world it kind of goes back to the type of people again where like it seems like everybody and their mama is in the media and entertainment field and me working in a media and entertainment company right now i don't really want that really in a potential partner going through the dating space and everything everyone's a producer or a filmmaker a photographer an actor it's like yo where are the teachers at where are the social workers i am looking for just boring bob where is that person okay maybe not boring but you know what i mean where is the gym teacher and so yes that's everyone and their mama i think that's really all i can say about that that and yeah the whole thing like being into appearances and being into all these things like they're over here with their designers and their watches and their oh my gosh it's like please i i cannot and so yeah i tapped out of that real quick what i will say though is la's definitely has a much more diverse pool of people which is much better than you know how it was where i lived before and so there's a lot more diverse pool of people but this can kind of be like a good and bad thing because yes there's more diversity so you can find what you're looking for but because there's a lot of people it's gonna take a while to find that thing it's gonna take a while to really get that gym teacher and because again there are so many people there ends up being the mentality of but like you don't want to stick with that person because what if there's something better and there will always be you know something better this is always going to be someone more good-looking someone you know more exciting and so it makes it harder to just set up shop somewhere now keep in mind i'm just saying this off of what you know friends and people have like said to me i haven't really seen that but then again i haven't really stuck around in that scene to see it but i that's what i have been told by the people who have experienced it here so yes that's really all i say about dating hopefully you find what you want here if you're looking to just take things light and have fun and meet people then yeah this is a great place to do that and then lastly just general living and activities and whatnot i really love la for having pretty much everything and anything i could want if i want the city downtown l.a if i'm on the beach santa monica if i want to hike there's all these parks if i want to i don't even know go and experience a whole nother town then i can go up to san francisco anything you want i truly can't think of something i would want that couldn't get right here and so that's something that's really great and that's definitely why so many people are attracted to california because you can truly get anything you want here you may have to look for it and search for it like it's not going to come to you on a silver platter likely but you can find it and i think that's something to be very excited about when thinking about your move here and so no there we go everybody my 30 day reflection of la overall there's been good times there's been bad times i've had to get more accustomed with the downtown life but as i go through more and more days and walk around and all of this i actually start loving a lot more especially when it's nighttime and there's the glistening lights and the tall buildings and the really nice summer air it's actually a really great time but yeah i hope this was somewhat helpful if you're thinking about moving here please let me know down below where you want to move please like and subscribe and i'll see you all later bye"}
