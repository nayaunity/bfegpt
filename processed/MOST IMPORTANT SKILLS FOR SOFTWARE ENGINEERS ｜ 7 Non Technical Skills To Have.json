{"video_title": "MOST IMPORTANT SKILLS FOR SOFTWARE ENGINEERS \uff5c 7 Non Technical Skills To Have", "transcript": "hello everybody my name is nyan i'm the black female engineer i provide content for new and aspiring software engineers and today we are talking about the skills you need to be a successful software engineer that aren't technical so what are they number one organization y'all the amount of time people can save by truly being very organized in their coding is pretty insane especially when you're working with a team and you are able to be that team member who gives that next person very nice clean code imagine just going about your day and then you are handed a project and it's just haywire in the files functions go are everywhere variables all these things are just everywhere imagine how much harder your day now is because the person before you who had this project did not organize their things well so that is why it's very very important because it can save you loads of time for not only yourself but for your whole team and make sure that you if you don't have organizational skills you practice it now during your coding you can do this by making sure that your functions are grouped in a way that makes sense by making sure that your functions aren't also you know 20 lines long but you have you know very short concise functions for each different operation being done by doing these little things you really can really positively affect the trajectory of your project so make sure you practice that today number two you need to be very very very detail-oriented the amount of times i have spent hours just going through my code now understanding why it's not working why i'm getting this error on my browser every time i try to run my code and see that it's because i had a comma somewhere that it wasn't supposed to be or i had an extra number somewhere x y and z it's ridiculous and so where does being detail oriented come in well not necessarily for what you would think for not creating those errors but for finding them when they occur if you're able to really clearly go through things with a fine-tooth comb that's gonna be great for error handling because errors are gonna happen and so this isn't even about like oh you won't like get these errors like and you know by being detail-oriented either you will you know contract less errors but it's really more for once the errors come you are able to really swiftly go through your code with this fine-tooth comb and find boom there's a comma and then taking it out and then boom your code works your project is up and it's ready to launch and so really making sure that you can have that eye and not just peruse through and miss all these little tiny little details splattered all over you know your code and everything your files it really really can make all the difference for you and your team to practice this first thing you really need to make sure to do is once you get that error look up where error is what line is being spit out at you as sorry this line it's not working for us nothing it's not always right um the line that your computer says is the problem but by being able to first look at that and then see what type of error it is and going from there it can very much assist in that error handling process and so really make sure that you don't just go straight away from oh my code isn't working too now let me try to figure out what my code is and changing all these things without ever looking at where your computer says your code is and why your code is so really make sure you practice those things next you need to be a problem solver there are a bajillion one ways to produce the same exact thing when it comes to code think of it this way there are so many ways to get the number two to show up you can do one plus one three minus one you can do four divided by two same with your coding there are so many ways to get the same answer to get the same result to get the same thing to pop up so you need to be able to when something doesn't work be able to say okay let's try this way and then that doesn't work okay let's try it this way and just being able to fix your mind in a certain way where it can think of things in completely different ways and figure out different approaches to a problem in order to get the answer is pertinent to the role seriously it is so so so so important being able to think creatively in order to find the right approach be a problem solver and really just look at this as a puzzle that you need to just put together it really really will assist in the whole development process seeing this as more of a puzzle rather than you know you not being able to get the answer and so yeah be a problem solver and so that actually goes into our next point which is be patient be patient specifically with yourself think of it more like i just said less about ah i just i'm just so bad at this and you know i can't do x y and z like no you are just a person trying to solve a puzzle and so when you are faced with a 500 piece you know jigsaw puzzle and all you don't beat yourself up saying oh i'm so stupid or oh i just am not right for this just because pieces aren't fitting because you know the working piece is in there somewhere and so think of this the same way like okay this did not work that is okay we have all of these other pieces that we can try to make it work i just need to get there and so making sure that you're patient with yourself and are really maintaining that positive attitude will seriously get you farther in this process in this journey because you are not you know putting yourself down you don't like who would want to go to a job that they constantly felt stupid that they constantly felt like they weren't good enough like you don't want that for yourself you want to be able to go to a job which you say today we're going to you know solve x y and z and we're going to figure out different ways to do it and come back home and do it all the next day and so yeah be patient with yourself know that this at the end of the day they're all just puzzles and you will find the matching piece at some moment the next thing that you need to be able to do is know how to ask the right question it is so so underrated the power of asking the right question has it can seriously be the difference from knowing and answering three hours versus three minutes let's say you're stuck on creating you know a navigation bar for your web app asking a question like how do i write a line my nav bar while keeping the list items in line that's a much better question than how do i make sure that the words in the nav bar stick together it is so important to be able to ask the right questions so that the people around you know exactly what you are looking for and can provide you with the right answer people just expect software engineers to be these people who just spend eight hours a day just coding things out and then go home so much time is spent asking questions however the difference between being the most liked person on the team to the least liked person is knowing the questions to ask you need to make sure that the questions you ask aren't wasting your time other people's time and are really really targeting the issue at hand and so know how to really zone in on the problem and ask the correct question whether it be to your manager to google et cetera both of them are able to help you but help them help you now this last skill that you all need to have is being able to obtain a future mindset in your coding so what does this mean i like to describe it as developing for the future coding for the future where i will code now a certain way knowing that i'm going to be using this function to give me a certain result and that result is going to determine x y and z and so i need to make sure i account for certain inputs for certain variables for certain you know numbers if they if there's a possibility of numbers being negative or a decimal and accounting for that in my code now of course this takes practice and it takes a lot of foresight but it's something that can really limit the amount of times you have to go back and edit previous code because oh i didn't realize you know there's a possibility of a negative number happening so let me make sure i account for that in my code or oh i didn't realize x y and z so let me go back here it can really limit that by being able to think a few steps ahead at what the end goal is and how all the ways a user can use your functions or the functions can work and being able to account for that now in your development it's something that yeah is truly truly truly can make all the difference and like i said it takes practice but practice it now there are ways you can practice that now by saying okay if you know if the number's positive do this but if the number is negative do this having if statements having try catch really being able to account for the different scenarios that can come up in the future that's really how you do and so everybody i hope some of y'all have been able to see certain skills that it's like okay you know what i really do need to hone in on my organization i really need to hone in on you know being detail oriented i hope this has done that for you if it has please let me know by liking below and don't forget to subscribe to my channel i love seeing this community grow and i really just appreciate it when you all support me and my channel and yeah don't forget to follow me on instagram at the black female engineer and i will see y'all later bye y'all"}
