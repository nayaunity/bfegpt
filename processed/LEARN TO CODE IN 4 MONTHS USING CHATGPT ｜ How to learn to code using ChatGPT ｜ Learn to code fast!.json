to learn before breaking out your notebook breaking out your computer and starting your week one or your week six or your week eight is asking chat GPT this simple question ready hello everybody my name is Naya and I'm the black female engineer I provide content for new and aspiring software engineers and today we're going to be talking about chat GPT really the thing everybody and their model has been talking about but today we're really going to talk about how we can use chat gbt to learn to code in pretty lightning speed so let's get into it [Music] so quick story time in 2020 I went to a coding boot camp for four months it was a 16 week coding boot camp and it cost an arm and a leg literally over fifteen thousand dollars now I do not know and I kind of already don't think I would have done that or at least been so quick to do that if Chad gbt had been a thing then as it is now the reason for this is because I would have simply gone to chat.openai.com and asked hey I want to learn to code in four to six months I have this amount of time I can devote to learning to code what should my study plan be what should my lesson plan be what should I devote each day to learning and then it would have said well well first do this then do this then do this and boom I don't need to spend fifteen thousand dollars to go to a coding boot camp because I have an instructor and a guide right here so it is now it is not then so really the best thing I can do now is simply show you all how I would have gone about that process and how you can save all that money save all that headache and become a software engineer in four to six months I'll use the time frame of four months for this video because that's what my boot camp was but you can alter this to be whatever amount of time you want so first things first the way you would go about using chatgpt to learn to code in four months and eventually get a job is first we need to figure out how we are going about studying how many hours we are devoting per week towards this and how to break out those hours per day per week Etc if you've been wanting to learn to code one of the questions you may be asking is shoot I am a full-time worker I don't have the time where do I even put the time to learn to code and just the confusion and worry of that all the angst of that all stopping you from learn to code in general so let's get rid of that right now and ask Chad gbt how we should schedule our days in order to get our hours in so I only get my laptop right here and straight up right now ask how many hours per week should be put in for this goal and boom right there we see that it says 20 to 30 hours per week should be devoted to learning to code if your timeline is for months for getting everything you need to know to get a junior software engineer doing your full stack developer type role so now we know we need 20 to 30 hours allocated towards coding per week where do we put this time let me ask chat GPT I'm gonna put in how many hours I work full time or part-time in really any blockers to my time I may have me personally I'm a 24 year old I don't have dependents I don't have really anything other than a full-time job stopping me from going towards this goal so I'm going to put that in and see what it says and real quick another thing that's important to me is having time to rest I feel like I would just experience so much brain frying if I just wet ham just seven days a week no rest days no time off and so I'm going to actually tell Taj Deputy to let Sundays be a rest day and see what it says so very clearly here it says to devote two hours in the morning before work three hours in the afternoon during lunch and two hours in the evening after work towards learning to code this right here gives us what four and a half hours per day and on top of that learn to code on Saturdays for four to six hours I love that Saturday isn't a full work day because it lets me do what I said before still enjoy my weekend still enjoy the opportunity to rest socialize X Y and Z that allows us 26 and a half to 28 and a half hours of coding of learning to code per week which is just under that 30 hour threshold it had put as our Max which I think is pretty damn good okay perfect we know how many hours per week to devote to this we know how to structure our week and our days to learn to code so now let's ask chai gbt what our week by week lesson plan should look like I'm going to Simply ask what should I spend each week learning please provide a 16 week breakdown and here it is just pitting it all out for us so it's one to two three to four five to six all the way and so on until week 16. so that's great we have an outline of what we should focus on each week what lessons what types of Concepts we should focus our energies on week by week however like I just said it's really just an outline and outlines are great it helps us see Direction but when I don't know what I don't know I'm gonna need more than just an outline so I now week by week I'm going to ask for a detailed breakdown of what I should be learning let's start out with that very first output weeks one and two 2. Chachi BT said to focus on HTML and CSS Basics along with finishing off the week with some JavaScript sounds great um what Basics what Basics are we talking about so let me ask Chad GPT this specific question what HTML and CSS Concepts should I learn during weeks one and two and with that question it spits out all of the detailed lessons I should focus on for those weeks structure and syntax elements and tags attributes semantic HTML HTML forms and that's just the HTML now for CSS it says selectors box models styling properties layout and positioning so now I can reasonably feel like I have the true proper direction for week one of my learning and then to really make sure we have everything solidified we need some type of way to test what we've learned test if what we have learned is enough to move forward and so again let's ask chat to be T how we can test that after learning HTML and CSS for one week what is a good way to test my aptitude and here lists out a couple of different things you can do the two I would love for you all to focus on are creating a basic site and replicating a basic site those are two very good ways of testing your skills and also refining your skills while uh while learning at the same time now this is great right we know what we should learn when we should learn it and all that but okay how are we going to learn it we need some resources so I'm going to ask hey what free resources do you recommend for me learning HTML and CSS it spits out some recommendations some you have heard me talk about if you are not using my channel for example free code Camp I love that's how I started learning specifically HTML CSS and some I haven't spoken about too much but they're definitely worth your time definitely go through the list and see which resources you like the most which ones work best for your learning style and which ones don't and finally the last type of all of this before starting to learn and before breaking out your notebook picking out your computer and starting your week one or your week six or your week eight is asking chat GPT this simple question ready if you were trying to teach me HTML for the very first time what would you say now of course HTML can and should be replaced with whatever you'll be learning that week but the reason this is so important is because it will provide you the proper uh basic understanding for why what you're learning is important why you're learning what you're learning and what to expect in your lessons when we're in week two and we're learning JavaScript I would ask the same question If you're trying to teach me JavaScript for the very first time what would you say to me that way I understand the importance of this concept of this language and use that to get me through my days and my weeks follow this formula for each week each concept you are supposed to be learning one ask what specific Concepts you should be learning for that week you are in remember with ht1 CSS it gave us the very clear um items that we should be checking off the list while we're learning and that's how we know how far deep we're in and we can use that to track our progress number two ask how you can test your knowledge for what you've been learning for the week one we saw that by replicating a site or building a basic site that is a great way of testing our HTML and CSS knowledge three ask what resources are best feel free to also include any other uh things that would be important to you in a resource is it free is it low cost does it provide videos is it mostly reading based feel free to include any parameters you'd want chat GPT to include in this answer then finally ask if you were trying to teach me X for the very first time trying to teach me HTML CSS JavaScript react sequel for the very first time what would you say to me another way you can phrase this question is explain this concept so that a six-year-old could understand explain so and so so that somebody with no previous experience can understand and then boom you are very well on your way towards a career in software development all thanks to chat GPT so there you go everybody I hope this was helpful please let me know what your thoughts are what things are y'all trying to learn even if it's not coding related if it is if if catch EBT has already helped you in some way please put it down in the comments because I would love to know I'd love to get the new ideas of what things I can learn in the future so thank you so much y'all and I hope you have a great rest of your day bye all oh my God this what is this yeah be attacked three two yeah"}
