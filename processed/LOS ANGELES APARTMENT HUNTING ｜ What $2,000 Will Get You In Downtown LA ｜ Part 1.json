content for new and inspiring software engineers and i went apartment hunting last week yeah last week i went apartment hunting i'm moving to los angeles which is wild to me i've wanted to move to los angeles for a very long time i'm moving for a job i have a new job as a software engineer in the animation realm in the entertainment realm and so i need a place to live i'll be moving in a couple of weeks shoot oh my gosh i'm moving in like two weeks oh my gosh yeah moving in like two weeks i start my job in about a month and so i decided to take you all along with me i'm going to break this up so that you get everything you want out of this video and so i'm going to start off with my own budget and my own you know needs and wants of an apartment then i'll go into the different tours and we'll talk about each tour and then close it off and so look at the bookmarks on this video and you can fast forward to whichever part you're most interested in but let's start off with what i was looking for so my budget was in the 1500 to 2 000 range ideally i didn't want to pass that thousand dollar ceiling i was primarily looking at places in korea town and downtown los angeles i would have loved looking in places in hollywood as well but with the size i was looking at apartments at and everything i just didn't find anything online that i even wanted to tour in that price range and so sadly i kind of had to let go of that dream um i primarily looked at apartments via apartments.com and westside rentals and so i'll link those two below if you also are going to be apartment hunting soon and so yeah what were my needs and my wants pretty much my number one need was laundry on site if not in the unit itself and the unit itself i guess was a very deep want but for the right building and right neighborhood and if everything else was amazing i could live with just laundry in building and so really this was a big non-negotiable like yeah i lived in new york before i've had the experience of going to laundromats and everything and i don't i don't like the inconvenience of it and so i really wanted it at least at least at least in the building my second need was it needed to be at least 600 square feet i really didn't care if it was a studio or one bedroom as long as 600 square feet i currently live in a studio that's about 515 square feet and it's a studio but i'm i'm looking at it it's a studio but it feels like a one bedroom because right behind like right here there's this wall that separates the bedroom and living room and the only thing missing a door which is why it's considered a studio and not a one bedroom but i've loved this space and to me for just me myself and i it is more than enough space for me the reason i wanted to upgrade to 600 square feet is because i wanted an actual office corner like a legitimate office it didn't need to be a whole room but a legitimate space for an office since i'll be primarily work from home or hybrid from the sounds of things and so i wanted to have a really nice space dedicated to that so yes 600 square feet studio or one bedroom i really didn't care my third need was updated appliances i needed a nice updated kitchen and the nice bathroom those are things i really care about um i really don't like older looking styles and ovens and stoves and countertops and things like that i really like things to look more modern and for me that was quite a big need and then lastly lots of natural light lots of my current spot gets tons of natural light and it truly makes me so happy every single day when i go to the kitchen i look and i am just overwhelmed with light i don't even turn my lights on until like 8 p.m y'all because of this big window i have and it's west facing and so it's so perfect and so i really needed that in my next apartment because i am a person who can very much be affected um my mood can be affected by sunlight sunlight and weather and so i really wanted to have as much access to that as possible now for my wants and i'm looking at my laptop because that's where my notes are and my wants really were dishwasher i don't really care about dishwasher but with my need of having updated appliances in a nice kitchen i imagine a dishwasher would be thrown in there but in terms of just writing things down i really didn't don't care for a dishwasher um laundry and unit private balcony again access to that sunlight and weather and just yeah lifting up my mood especially if i'm work from home being able to just access the outside whenever i wanted to near a park that would be a great want i currently live near park and it has been a game changer and a nice neighborhood nice neighborhood because i care about where i live i care about you know what's going to go on here at 3am when i'm walking back home from wherever from work or maybe not 3am but you know when once the sun goes down i don't want to or i want to minimize my feelings of unsafety and unrest but because of where i live and the neighborhood i'm in and so i really wanted a nice neighborhood but i put it towards a wand because depending on different things i could budge a little bit here and there but yes i want a nice neighborhood okay so now let's go into the actual apartment search this is just part one there will be two parts released for today for next week so make sure you subscribe and put those reminders on so no let's look at that first [Music] apartment [Music] tell me [Music] tell me [Music] um [Music] so this apartment was priced at two thousand twenty dollars a month at around 755 square feet and so definitely like a lot cheaper in terms of what i got for square footage but i wasn't a fan of the layout as you can see the kitchen was in like tucked away in like what i would think would be kind of like a hallway and so i didn't really like that layout but i loved the updated kitchen and the updated bathroom did you see that bathroom did you see that sink in the bathroom i just was blown away by that i love the cabinets i loved the finishes so much and just in general the apartment itself i really really liked that big window was amazing because of course it provided a lot of natural light especially because that apartment was west facing so that would be amazing amazing amazing and so in general i could make do with that floor plan because i just loved that modern look so much but in terms of the building itself it definitely was an older building and it didn't really have a lot of facilities provided there was a rooftop but it really was just like i don't even know this little square that was able to fit only like two lounge chairs and a grill and so it wasn't really anything special and i mentioned how much i loved that gorgeous window but the thing is the apartment was located in not the nicest of areas it was in downtown los angeles and so it wasn't in the nicest of areas in downtown and so i wouldn't even really like what i was looking at you know what i mean and so those are a few things that i needed to consider but in all in all in terms of the apartment itself i really liked um the overall look and feel of it other than the floor plan now that being said i was able to tour a different floor plan of theirs in the same building that also would be available for me to move into so let me show you that real quick before i go into everything else i liked and disliked [Music] as mentioned this unit was in the same building as the previous unit you just saw and i loved this floor plan so much more and for prices it was 1970 a month hundred and seventy dollars for 642 square feet and i loved this apartment especially because of that divider a lot of people might not like it but i actually really appreciated it because it provided a division between the living room and the bedroom because where i would imagine the bedroom would be for me is past that divider and so it also was a studio and so i just liked that separation and just the floor plan in general it also was west facing with that gorgeous window gorgeous appliances gorgeous kitchen and bathroom i still am thinking about that bathroom that sink those tiles i'm still thinking about it all and so i really loved that with this specific apartment with this specific unit so i already appreciated the cost of the apartment given the square footage but on top of it they were offering 12 months of free parking which for the all of the apartments i've looked at would cost between 150 to 300 a month for me which is like a whole nother bedroom that's like adding a whole nother bedroom to your apartment and so that's wild to me and i will be bringing my car and so the fact that they were offering 12 months free parking was insane insane to me and so i loved this unit but really the biggest thing i would be focusing on and considering was that location piece when envisioning my walk home from pretty much anywhere it the surrounding area is a bit of an eyesore with you know trash just the area it was in wasn't great because downtown l.a has parts of it where it's not the best it's not the most aesthetic but then they have parts that look so majestic so beautiful so glamorous and so i was in this apartment in the former and so those would be things i would need to consider let's now go on to the next [Music] apartment [Music] so [Music] the second apartment i loved it was so beautiful so just spacious and had all this natural light it was 1990 per month 1990 and it was in koreatown and as you can see it was a very updated apartment the property manager actually told me that that one i saw the one in the video has actually never been resided in and so i would be the very first person to rent it out which was a huge huge plus for me and i think if you look closely at some of the things you can actually still see like plastic and all these different things still there and so i loved that so much it had washer dryer in unit and i'm glad that the video was able to pick up how much natural light it got it was east facing so i'd get a nice amount of lights i really loved that and in terms of the building itself the apartment i believe has only been up or only been open for about two years the entire building and so it's very new and their facilities were insane i've never heard facilities like this so let me list them out for you it was they had a community room they had a rooftop pool they had a movie theater they had a gym and a karaoke room like what what what and so i was truly blown away by all of the things that were offered i can't remember if i already said this but it was 607 square feet and so right at the you know minimum square feet for me and it was all open as you can see so no legit you know bedroom or anything which i'm truly fine with but i really appreciate this apartment a lot now the things i didn't appreciate so much was the location so it was in korea town but i didn't like the actual street it was on the actual block so it was on the corner of the street and on that exact corner there was all this trash all this just like dirt and just uncleanliness going on and so that really just was i was not a fan of and i took some time to walk around the block a little bit and i didn't like the block i really the neighborhood specifically that it was in and so that was quite the con for me and i didn't like that it was more removed from downtown los angeles that really is where i was trying to be as much as possible because i've never lived downtown downtown anywhere before right now i live about 10 minutes from downtown and so i really wanted that experience that 20-something experience of living downtown in a big city and everything so that also was a con how it's a little bit far removed but it's not by that much just like a 10 minute drive so nothing crazy but yeah those were my two cons but other than that i just loved the apartment and the building and so yeah now let's go to the next [Music] apartment [Music] so [Music] so for me this apartment was okay it was 1957. a month for 707 square feet however i didn't really like how much older things were the finishes were the appliances the kitchen was all right but i did not like the bathroom at all at oh oh my gosh and that's something like kitchen and bathroom are things that are pretty important to me especially because that's where you can see the age of an apartment pretty well and so i was not the biggest fan i was not a fan of the location the location was in an area that was kind of just a bit of an eyesore it was in downtown los angeles and it was just not the best location not really somewhere i would love to go home to every single day or walk home to every single day or every other day or whenever i walk home because it's work from home and i stay home all the time but yeah whenever chose to go out and exercise my legs a little bit i would like something more aesthetic a little bit more aesthetic to look at a little bit more pleasing to the eye and this really wasn't that the building however had amazing facilities they had this gorgeous rooftop and an amazing like events room that you could rent out and have all these gorgeous glamorous piece of china and just it was gorgeous it was very very beautiful they had these really cute details um to the building because the building i think was almost 100 years old if not over 100 years old and so it had fun little details here and there from the elevators and the finishings of that little libraries headed around and all of that and so i really liked the character of the building so much but when it came to the apartment itself i wasn't that great of a fan one thing the apartment really did have going for it though as you can see was amazing natural light and so i really appreciated that but i also didn't like how there was no washer dryer in the unit and it was just on site and for me to be fine with on-site i kind of need to have everything else kind of perfect for me to be okay with washing dryer not in unit and so that was just not the case here and so that was pretty disappointing yeah let's yeah after my apartment hunt was over i was able to sign a lease so i do have a place based on the videos you either see here today or next week in my part two and so put in the comments below do you think you saw the apartment that i decided to go with do you think you saw my future home in this video and in general what was your favorite because like different things matter to different people and i totally understand that so i
