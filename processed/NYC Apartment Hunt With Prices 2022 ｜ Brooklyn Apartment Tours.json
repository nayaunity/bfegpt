{"video_title": "NYC Apartment Hunt With Prices 2022 \uff5c Brooklyn Apartment Tours", "transcript": "hello everybody my name is Nyan I'm the black female engineer and today we are going apartment hunting in New York I am so excited this is something I have been trying to do and by this I mean renting in New York I've been trying for the last like six months I came down here back in August and did some apartment hunting and oh my goodness it's it was quite awful but yes we're apartment hunting so here are the details for the Tesla Apartments I'm looking for along with the price ranges so I'm going to bring out my computer so I can make sure I have everything organized but here they are okay my price range is three thousand to five thousand dollars for an apartment keep in mind these expenses are going to be shared and so per person I'm looking at 1500 to 2500 per person but yes in terms of the overall apartment three thousand to five thousand dollars for at least a one bedroom but I really want a two bedroom so here are the things that are my needs I'm pretty simple really under the needs category it comes down to having at least one full bedroom having laundry in building at the very least and updated finishes then in terms of wants I really want two or more bedrooms and laundry inside the unit itself and to be even more particular like not those European style like one machine laundry like I want a separate washer dryer two different units in the apartment that would really be fantastic for me really really my focus is Brooklyn I used for this entire hunt streeteasy.com it was actually a pretty simple process just sending a quick message whenever I wanted to tour a place and by that night or the next morning I'd hear back and so it was pretty simple and I very much recommended for New York City at least so without further Ado let's check out the very first apartment [Music] amen [Music] thank you foreign [Music] foreign [Music] and this was for 850 square feet it was in Brooklyn specifically in Bushwick and I really liked it it had really great amenities the building did it had a gym pretty like small boutique gym with like maybe like four machines and some free weights but honestly that's all I need it had a gym and also a rooftop deck and so when it's warm I'm sure I would enjoy having that you know available and so really there aren't many qualms about this unit also had the washer dryer in unit the separate washer dryer and I was really shocked to see that it had two full bathrooms not one and a half bathrooms but two full ones on top of there being two full bedrooms and so overall I really did like this unit now something that I did not like and really like only real big thing that I didn't like was that because of where it is so it's in Bushwick traveling in other places in Brooklyn and specifically to Manhattan would be a bit more strenuous than I would like it to be it would take probably 30 40 50 minutes going to certain areas and I don't really like that I don't know New York too too well I haven't I can't say that I've explored too much of it and so I want a place that I can easily hop around and it won't be too arduous especially with these cold months coming in so that's one thing to note but yeah overall I really did like this unit so overall that is that unit let's check out the next foreign [Music] foreign [Music] thank you foreign [Music] so this unit where did we get okay let's start with just like things I didn't like which are many let's start with just things I didn't like one the bathroom if you saw is in the kitchen which is disgusting just [Music] that alone like get me get me out of here um the bathroom was in the kitchen it was one it was only one bathroom and only like one bedroom now get this on Street Easy the listing was for said two bedrooms the reason it qualified as two bedrooms is because in the living room the place where I had the fireplace there and I'll try to add the specific clip here there's a small divot in the ceiling that I guess according to New York law that divot makes it qualify as two bedrooms there's no door there's no separate like divide there's no wind like just that small little thing made it qualify as two bedrooms that's absurd because yeah get understand my disappointment when I showed up to that unit that showing and I'm expecting two bedrooms and one bathroom and the bathroom is in the kitchen and it's only one bedroom and because of the way it's tiled so there are separate entrances to the unit there's an entrance to go into the living room and there's an entrance to go into the kitchen there's no entrance for like that middle room what ideally probably would be someone's bedroom if I have guests over and they need to go to the bathroom or go to the kitchen because they're in the same place um they would need to go through that big that my bedroom they'd have to get through my bedroom to go to the kitchen or the bathroom and vice versa or go outside into the Hall to do to get to the different places logistically that just sounds like an absolute Nightmare and just absolute awful like I don't want any part in it at all like I'm okay this unit was four thousand dollars for 700 square feet as well so in terms of like the money uh like what you're getting for your money it really to me wasn't much uh but I did like the neighborhood the neighborhood it was Williamsburg and so that's pretty close to Manhattan and just other places in Brooklyn making it super efficient to hop around uh pretty just pretty easily if that is something I liked about the unit but other than that yo I I didn't like it at all at all let me see was there anything else yeah yep that that's about it that was that unit so let's check out the next y'all [Music] foreign [Music] thank you [Music] this next unit was forty two hundred dollars but because it had two months free it actually ended up being about thirty five hundred dollars for a 12 month lease which is actually really good especially because of the space this unit had that honestly is the biggest thing going for this apartment it was watch let me check it was 1 000 square feet had an upstairs and a downstairs and it was in the neighborhood that I actually really love it was also in Williamsburg so just like I was talking before I could easily hop around whenever I so pleased now that being said yes I love this face so so much a thousand square feet is really great especially for that price but because it was just one large basement area and not divvied up in any way so the primary bedroom is in the basement and then any office area that I need would need to be in the basement as well I work from home if that means I'm spending a majority of my day underground basically which I do not appreciate that much so I had a lot of space and was in the location that I really loved and it did have a washer dryer but as for amenities that was pretty much it overall it was pretty it was an okay unit it was good love the space don't really love that part of me spending most of my time in the basement unless I need food and that's when I would go up to the kitchen and Scurry back down to the basement again and so yeah that's really my biggest qualm about this unit and so let's check out the last unit foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] have you ever seen like an apartment or a pair of shoes or honestly anything that you see nothing really wrong with it but you just don't like it like at all that was me with this unit for some reason which is really weird because it was super modern I had really nice finishes the person who toured the place said that we would be the first people in that unit because there's a whole new building and all that and so it was really nice looking and really just yeah just cool in that way but for some reason I just did not like it it had three bedrooms and two bathrooms which it's the yeah which means it's the apartment in this list with the most amount of bedrooms and that would provide a lot of flexibility in terms of just organizing this place because it would allows for the ability to have the full primary bedroom while also having either two full office spaces or a guest bedroom and an office on top of that and so I really did enjoy that flexibility and yeah I know like you you all I think need to tell me what you think about this unit because I do like that industrial look of it it had the washer and dryer that I needed two full bathrooms along with the three full bedrooms and it was very modern and clean but yeah those are the four units for this video I did about 10 at least 10 tours which I do plan to create like a whole series of the different apartments I toured but yeah let me know in the comments which ones you guys are leaning towards which ones are absolute nose and which ones you think based off of my commentary I need to take a second look at because maybe I'm not seeing something that should actually be at the top or near the top of my list so let me know what you guys think and yeah I'm gonna see y'all very soon so thank you so much have a great rest of your day bye"}
