{"video_title": "TECH STARTUP VS. LARGE COMPANY\uff1a Which Is Better As a New Developer", "transcript": "hello everybody my name is nyan i'm the black female engineer i provide content for new and aspiring software engineers and today we're going to be talking about which is better a startup or a big company so let's figure that out starting with the day-to-day that you can expect of these two types of companies starting with a startup with a startup you can expect to do many different things and not just your duties as a developer or as an engineer you'll be expected to help out in marketing you'll be expected to assist in design to assist in some admin work it really is not just you doing the coding and then someone else doing something else you'll be touching the different parts of the business now this can be very good for people who get bored easily or people who want to learn different parts of your business maybe you're looking to one day create your own startup create your own business this is a great way to know what goes into that however there are long hours you can expect longer maybe not long long depending on the startup but you can expect longer hours than that of a large corporation because you're touching all these different things you are gonna have to stick around longer if the site crashes then it's you has to wake up at 2 am to get the code base running again and make sure things are good there's not all these different people who can do that job when you're not at the desk and so that is where things can get tricky now going to a larger company you definitely will have more of a likelihood of having the straight eight-hour workday 40 hours a week and not needing to extend your hours or be in all these different roles you can expect to have one job and one job only one project you're working on for a year one feature you're working on and that is that this can be great for people who like to know what their day will look like who get anxious i know me i get anxious wondering what tomorrow holds and of course there's you know elements of that but in terms of what you're responsible for what is expected of you that doesn't really change now where things can get tricky is you could get bored easier because you're doing this one thing and also you are working on an already existing project likely if it's a big company it's probably been here for decades the project and the product you're working on has been here long before you were here and you'll be here long after you're gone so it's less innovative i'd say you feel less innovative you're working on maintaining code and you're working on fixing bugs and maybe making processes better or faster so it can be less innovative because of that however with this you'll get to know one thing really well so it can be very great professionally now going into pay and benefits so with a large company you can expect a better amount of cash coming your way just in terms of base pay and bonuses however i'm not really sure to be honest who wins in this category startup or large company and here's why with a startup where they make up for their probably lower base pay is with their stock options especially if they are private if they're a small company odds are they are private now why is this important stock options when a company goes public you can end up very rich very fast because you are able to get stock at a discount and now that the company is public all these people are getting their stock the stock is much higher and now you are able to get compensation in the form of stock in like a crazy like three-fold four-fold eight-fold amount so here's a funny example of this so you can really get what i mean so when facebook bought whatsapp the 55 employees that worked for whatsapp they got three billion dollars to split between them with the early developers employees that were with them from day one day to day three getting up to 150 million dollars yeah yeah so that's what i mean when we say when i say i don't know which is better now i'm not saying to go to a startup so you can become a billionaire and then so don't be coming at me when you don't get millions a few years in like that is not what i'm saying the facebook example is an extreme example but it just illustrates my point you get a lower base pay but you get stock options and if your company is bought by a much larger company or they go public so they can now be you know traded upon you know the stock exchange and you know you can go on robin hood and get some stock then your compensation package looks a lot better on top of this there are also little tiny trinklets of benefits here and there with startups like being able to like drink at work like there are so many startups around me where there is a fridge full of beer and you know salsas and wines and you can just chill like your clothes like you can come up in here with your sweats and your loafers go to work it is so chill and relaxed and so that can be a big benefit for people in terms of their lifestyle at work at big companies like let's say you're a software engineer at a bank odds are there will still be some type of restrictions in terms of dress code for you i know when i worked at a bank this software engineer still looked pretty relaxed i was actually pretty shocked to be honest be me and my you know accountant finance mind and everything but um there you can expect just more restrictions than a startup however with a large company there are also you know more chances for like large events galas if holiday parties and all the works having food paid for and everything every single day at your office and just increased convenience so that's why i say with yeah a in terms of salary and things and benefits it's a toss-up it kind of depends how long you're looking to stay at that company what things are most important to you do you need that base pay or are you able to stick it around for five years to see if your company gets acquired or gets that ipo next we're going to talk about community it's probably not a shock that with a startup you can expect a more tight-knit group you can expect feeling more like a quanko family i personally that is a red zone word for me in terms of companies calling themselves families that's a conversation for a different day but it can feel just more tight-knit more like a closed community you know the people you're working with you probably will know more of the people in the entire company than you would a large company on top of that with a startup you have much more access to higher ups you can have access to the ceo the ceo the your senior managers you your boss himself could be the ceo i have friends where this is their situation and so in terms of learning and development it can be very inspiring to be around those people and to learn from those people again especially if you are looking to have a company for yourself in the future now when it comes to a large company odds are you won't know most of the people you will probably just know your team in terms of very very closely you will know your team and maybe a few people here and there outside of it but that's kind of it if you want to know more people outside of your team then you're going to have to put in that legwork of going to the happy hour going so and so event going to so-and-so soccer tryouts like you like you have to put in more work but it can also be really nice knowing that on any given day you'll meet five to ten new people maybe in terms of really meeting like talking to them like five to ten more people maybe you're very outgoing you can meet 100 people a day but yeah getting to know that you will always be meeting someone new from different teams different operations different lines of business that can be very exciting for some where some people with small companies startups they don't like the idea of after 30 days you know everything about everybody and it is just all all the time and you don't meet anyone new and all of that so it depends on the person you are i mentioned that with the startup you have more access to higher ups with a big company you have also very great access to robust and structured mentoring opportunities many times when you're new to a large company you're immediately set up with at least one mentor i know me i was set up with at least three people at a time would be a mentor a um like a senior mentor and then like a like buddy yes that's what they would call it a buddy and so it's a very robust mentoring process and that can be very very great for you if you are new to this realm of developing in a company so that can be something that is very attractive to you last thing about the community this is something that's very important to me if you came to this channel is likely important to you but people of color there are seven percent black people in the software and engineering realm in technology there are three percent black women in a small company a startup let's say the percentages are the same for startup versus large company startup that's seven people if you work for a company of 100. now for a large company if you work you know at a company that has 10 000 people in the building that's significantly more 700 yeah seven 700 people and so of course the percentages are the same but i mean i would rather get the chance to talk with 700 black people and you know we kick it than the seven people i don't know i don't that is just my thoughts on that and so yes there is more people of color more um women in larger companies because there's a larger sample size the percentage may be the same but is more of them so that is something to also think about if that's important to you the professional development part is something i've seen a lot of people kind skip over and that's what i'm going to mention it here with a startup you will be working with very innovative very cutting edge technologies features all the works all the bells and whistles and they're a lot more open to experimentation and trying new things and so if you like to be part of that process of seeing you know how to implement new features and coding those features out and all of that the startup may be the best place for you because in a big company again they have been here long before you came around they're not just about to switch their languages and frameworks just because you are here they will be using the same languages they've been using since the stone ages and all of that so it's something to think about when looking at these two different companies and on top of that with the startup you can actually envision yourself actually coding out these features because they don't exist yet you know what i mean like they are still in the development stages they're still working on building things from the ground up while with a big company it's been there and you just need to make sure it stays there and so really you're maintaining that code instead of building things up so in terms of feeling like you're really having a true impact around you a startup might be better however and this is for me what kind of steered me away from startups even though i would honestly love to be there at some point is there's not a very robust learning structure you come there great sit down we need this feature there's not really many people to train you there's not really many training materials created for you shoot you may be the person who's creating those learning materials for the people after you so if you're a person who really needs structure because you're new at this because you know you are still learning and processing things then that's when you kind of need to see what's more important because for me that's really what i focused on was shoot i don't know i'm sorry i cannot and so the idea of being put in an environment like that was very terrifying for me but i know if i was put in that environment i would have grown so quickly so quickly because i would have been forced to learn quickly and use that on the job so so rapidly so i know that my trajectory and my growth would have been like nothing else but then for me my stress would have also been like nothing else and then lastly mobility with the startup if you want to switch jobs you gotta start that job hunt all over again and you gotta really actually pack your bags and go with a large company if you want to change jobs you can just say to your boss look i want to work with xnx technology instead i want to work with a team that works on automation and robotics and i know you have that division down in texas i want to go there and that can be a much smoother transition and easier way to do that and it just was because of a conversation also thinking about not just business units but also locations if you care about being able to switch locations but also don't want to do that legwork of looking for a job each time a large company may be great because they have locations everywhere if you want to go to dubai go go okay it's not that easy but you see where i'm going with this you have a lot more flexibility and mobility with a larger company of course people need to trust you of course people need say you've been doing a good job and can actually contribute to your teams in different ways and all of that but if you can then having a conversation about locations you want to change or business could be no problem don't forget to subscribe to my channel and
