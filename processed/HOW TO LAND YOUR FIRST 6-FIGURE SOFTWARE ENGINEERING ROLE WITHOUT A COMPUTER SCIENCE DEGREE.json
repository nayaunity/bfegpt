{"video_title": "HOW TO LAND YOUR FIRST 6-FIGURE SOFTWARE ENGINEERING ROLE WITHOUT A COMPUTER SCIENCE DEGREE", "transcript": "and so yes i'm not saying you know i'm not saying but i'm just saying hello everybody my name is nyan i'm the black female engineer i provide content for you and aspiring software engineers and today we are talking about how to get your first six-figure job as a software engineer and may i say happy 2020 to y'all because oh my goodness i am feeling quite fantastic quite phenomenal i am very energized and just so so ready for turning 22 to be the year of change of getting it of just working as hard as i can to set up the rest of my life and i know that sounds like a lot but to be honest how i feel and if that's how you feel too then you are at the right place now huge huge thank you to flatiron school for sponsoring this video flatter school many of you already know was the cutting boot camp i attended in the summer of 2020 and so we're going to dive into that a little later in the video but first let's talk about how to get that coin in 2022 so let's get into it number one first thing you need to do so that you get that six figure offer is make sure you are learning in demand coding languages now for 2022 according to berkeley university the three most in demand languages will be javascript java and python so if you are starting to learn how to code now try to steer towards these three languages and actually had searched toward python and javascript when i was first learning and well look at us now oh yes make sure you are learning the most in demand languages because you want to make sure that when your resume gets to the doors of these hiring managers that they see okay so they are well versed and up to date with languages that we need the most and so like come on over here so yes make sure you're learning the most in demand language number two make sure you're packing your resume with transferable skills and projects whatever roles or experience you have or you have obtained in the past see how you can make it work to show how that would make you a fantastic software engineer and so when you think okay so let's say i've been a barista for the last five years and you may think okay well this has nothing to do with software engineering and you know it's just not gonna work for me like no you are wrong and i'm gonna show you why so you've been a barista that likely means that you are fantastic at communicating with others both customers and higher ups like managers and whatnot one you also are likely really great at handling multiple tasks at one time two on top of that i would bet you are fantastic at handling yourself in high pressure situations three right there i just gave you three skills to highlight on your resume to show employers why you would be a fantastic software engineer and the reason this is important is because a lot of employers will look at your resume and your past experience when trying to figure out what type of offer package to give you and so we don't want them to think oh so they have no you know previous experience and so let's give them this low ball offer and call it a day you want to show them like yo i know i'm new to this field of software engineering but i have a ton of skill that i will be using in this job to make me a great great software engineer and so that is why you want to do that now going to the project side projects are a fantastic way to show that you are well versed in a language or technology now what if you're thinking okay well that's great naya but how am i even gonna do this project like i can't even print hello world on the terminal like how about you get there well that is where our amazing sponsors flat out of school comes in flatter school is a coding bootcamp that really wants to make sure that you develop all the skills necessary to make sure that you come out a desirable hire and that includes through the making and building of projects like i said i went to florida school and i came out having built four projects all of which i had put on my resume and i actually didn't make any other projects other than the ones i built in flatiron school because they were in my opinion fantastic because slanted school equipped me with the tools necessary to build these amazing projects to show to employers and so definitely don't let another year go by where you're doing just the same old thing and just coasting through life i mean if you want if that's what you desire in life and love and everything then sure but i'm thinking you clicked on this video because you actually like me 1 2022 to be the year of change where you are setting up everything you need for your future and the thing is i'm talking about like for your future but with planner school you're actually able to go from barista to software engineer in as little as 15 weeks yeah yeah that was the case for me i started june i want to say 22nd of 2020 and i finished my bootcamp october 2nd of 2020 and that was actually the day i got my first ever job offer so like come on y'all like at the end of the 15 weeks you still have most of 2022 left to live your life in everything and so to me that sounds like an amazing deal so let's say you do love the idea of working in tech but software engineering isn't for you that is completely fine because fires school actually offers three other courses to pick from from data scientists to cyber security to product design and so when you think about all of that i don't know to me there's not much of an excuse to not at least try and if you do want to at least try flatter school also is allowing you all if you click on the link below to try multiple lessons for free free free free now you're able to dabble in these different courses and see which one resonates most with you because at the end of the day this is your life so you want to make sure that you actually are going to be enjoying what you're learning in flat iron school and this is the perfect opportunity to do so and if you apply today with the link in the description box below by may you can be calling yourself an employed software engineer isn't that insane like to me that's insane uh that's that's insane and so yes make sure the 2022 is the year of you the year of change the year of doing everything you need to do to make sure that you are waking up just so happy and in love with your life and your work and your day to day your monday well maybe not money i'm not i'm not too in love my monday um but her and i are acquaintances now anyway back to the whole subject so find a day with the link in my description box below and see what all can happen in 2022 so now let's go to number three just now that was transferable skills and projects number three think about location location location location so when you think about the offers people get for different roles in general it does not come as a shock to many of us that bigger cities offer larger salaries and pay than smaller ones side by side comparison here according to indeed.com if you get a job as a software engineer in new york city your salary would likely come out to a little over 125 1000 oh my goodness that's just so much money so 125 000 it was about 126 actually but if you get the exact same role in oklahoma your salary comes out to a little over 75 000 that's insane that's wild that's fifty thousand dollars right yes wow i was a finance major fifty thousand dollars right off the bat simply because of location and so you definitely wanna consider what specific locations you're applying to when you are applying for your roles now i know many of you will be saying hey knives girl um it costs way more money to live in manhattan new york than it does oklahoma you're correct you you you got me you are correct however one thing about these last two two years is we have seen that we are able to do our work most most of the time from anywhere especially a tech job and so when we consider the idea of being able to work from home or work anywhere in the country but being paid this big city salary then we're like okay or i'm i keep saying we me i'm like okay yeah maybe applying to jobs in new york city is the uh is the move and i'm actually speaking from experience my job i actually had the ability to work pretty much anywhere in the country i chose la because i'm 23 and wanted the lifestyle but the cost of living and everything i definitely feel it more than i would in albuquerque and so so think about that and remember that when you are job hunting and make sure that those are questions you ask because top fortune 50 companies are allowing their employees to work from home forever forever forever forever forever forever and so yeah definitely ask about that in your interviews and say okay so yeah i'm applying for this job based in san francisco can i go up here in nebraska and call it a day with the salary definitely don't ask it like that but yes definitely ask those questions because some companies you get the salary without getting that pain and hurt of a huge huge cost of living and number four lastly but definitely definitely definitely not least is you want to make sure you are networking network not only because that cements your odds of getting the role of being picked and chosen for this new job of yours but through the relationships you build networking one of the questions you may ask is how much can i expect to earn at so and so company my door just opened that was pretty creepy that was that was pretty creepy the door just like swung open so anyway through these relationships you build one of the questions you may feel compelled and comfortable asking is hey how much can i expect to earn at so-and-so company for this role either maybe the person actually works at that company that you are currently in the recruitment process for or they know of a person or they just know the industry but after a certain time of being in this in this field and talking to different people you know the industry and so you just kind of know certain things about things like pay and so definitely ask those questions because by asking and seeing what to expect it can definitely increase your confidence for going into negotiations if you know that the average is actually around 130 for this company and they come to you with 98 you can say hey may i pretty please get that hundred thirty and so make sure that throughout your learning process not even when you start the job hunt but throughout your learning process throughout your job hunt and active interviewing make sure you are building these relationships with other individuals and ask these types of questions because truly truly they can make all the difference there we go everybody my tips for how to get that six figure offer without
