for new and aspiring software engineers and today we are talking about how to survive the job hunt yeah yeah we are so close to 1 000 subscribers thank you so so much to all of you part of this community i i i appreciate you so much so i want to do something for y'all i want to do a little giveaway if you see this sweatshirt i'm wearing it says the black female engineer if you go follow me on instagram and also comment on my videos between now and the point i'm at 1 000 subscribers you will be in the running to get this hoodie i'll select three people in total i provide more details in the description box below so check those out but anyway let's get to it number one have a goal for your application process have a goal of how many applications you want to submit in a day in a week that way you always feel some sense of accomplishment because it's so easy to feel defeated while job hunting that you need something to be like yes okay i did that and that actually brings us perfectly to number two whatever that goal is try to complete it early in the early half of the day because in the you know process of just constantly feeling defeated you want to you don't want to end your day like that you don't want to go to bed feeling distraught feeling anxious feeling x y and z so do that at the beginning of your day as as much as close to the beginning of the day as possible and then that way you can go about your life and go to bed thinking about whatever the last thing you did was now it's no secret that job hunting can take a hot minute a hot a hot scorching so here's number three every one month at least every one month but i wouldn't say no more than like once every two weeks find something to revamp and i mean every one month of seeing just no movement seeing no calls for interviews seeing no y and z try to see what you can revamp can you do to your resume what can you do to your linkedin what can you do to your github to just make it better make it just feel fresher because then also after that you'll enter the new month of job hunting and applications with a new sense of hope because there may be something in there that's you know turning people away for some reason and honestly it doesn't take much these days but there might be something in there and you want to just keep on adding that edge to your applications number four i really wish i had done this mute email notifications for some part of your day y'all oh my gosh it it's not fun um going through your day having a great day you just went i don't know fishing with your dad he just caught a big fish came back had a great dinner and then boom you get two rejections for the job you really wanted mute email notifications for some point in the day now not for all the entire days and weeks because a lot of times when you get either interview invites or advice to complete coding questions those offers expire within 24 to 48 hours so don't do this like the entire day and blame me for anything but just make sure that you say you know what for the last six hours of my day i make sure that email notifications are off or even sync it with your working schedule if you are working right now saying only nine to five email notifications would be on other than that then like boom you can't reach me it feels a lot better knowing that during these times i'm more prepared to hear bad news number five track your applications track your applications because you may think like oh i don't need to track them want i don't want to see all the jobs that i'm not getting invites and interviews to and two you may think that's just like why it's out there so why do i need tracking you want to track your applications because one it gives you a sense of when you'll hear back from companies typically in my experience i would always hear back between two to like five-ish weeks after applying and so if week six came by and you know google has not responded to me then i can kind of plan my next steps do i know the email of the recruiter do i you know do i have a contact card from anybody or even from their website can i reach out and be like hey i just was inquiring about the status of my application and just getting some kind of update because knowing is better than not knowing for me unless you move on lets you figure out you know how to best proceed and so track your applications i actually have a job tracker which i have linked below it's free to use for you to download just copy the instructions below but yeah just something simple to know when things were sent out to know which companies you have interviews to and also what your next step is in terms of okay you just had an interview for these two companies make sure you send them thank you notes make sure you do x y and z and all of that and let me just add a note here it's also important to track because the i have heard stories this never happened to me but i've heard stories of my friends saying that if i hadn't gone back to this company saying hey i applied x amount of weeks ago and i just wanted to receive an update they wouldn't have gotten their interview because either the resume didn't go through correctly or they just forgot about them like you know we're all people so they just forgot even though their resume stood out and things like that and even just showing that you're interested even showing that you're keeping an eye on you know your notifications and you care it ended up giving them interviews and so that's also why it's important to track your application and finally it's so easy to just be like no i need a job now this was me i was like i need a job yesterday i need to just keep going keep hustling keep sending these out yo have a resting day have a resting day because it will keep you just in lighter spirits you know because if you're just so run down from the 45 days of continuous application sending by the time you even get that interview it's like you know what screw it i don't even want it anymore like you want to make sure you're keeping your spirits up as much as possible and if you just have one resting day just at least once some type of sacred day to you it'll help you so much more in the long run but please know i give none of these tips lightly i know the time i spent applying to jobs oh my gosh the anxiety levels i was not sleeping i was just running all of these scenarios in my head constantly especially when you fell in love with a job or a job description and they're like nah son that it's not fun so please no i'm not giving these lightly and i just am reflecting back on my experience and really some of these things i wish i had done some of the things i did do and i'm so glad i did and so just i hope you take that and it helps you out even just leave it just a little bit so thank you so much and i'll see y'all later bye"}
