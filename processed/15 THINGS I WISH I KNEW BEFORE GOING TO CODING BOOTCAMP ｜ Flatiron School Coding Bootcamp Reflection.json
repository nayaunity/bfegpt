engineer i provide content for new and aspiring software engineers and today we're going over 15 things i wish i knew before going to a coding bootcamp for those of you don't know i went to flat earth school exactly a year ago like i was in flat art school exactly a year ago but my time there was specifically from june to october so summer to fall of 2020 and yeah there are a few things i would have liked a heads up for and so i'm hoping to provide that all for you today so let's get to it number one bootcamp won't get you the job you got to do that yourself and what i mean by this is i feel like a lot of people have the notion of oh i'm gonna go to boot camp so i can get a job or once i get through boot camp then done like i'll be employed and then boom we're good all's great and that's not really how it goes really the mentality should be i'm gonna go to boot camp so i am employable but all the work of job hunting and the stress and recruiting and interviews is still on you that that isn't lifted because you went through boot camp even if they have career services available even if they have aid and assistance it's still you and it's a lot it's stressful it's like a full-time job all in itself but yes start preparing yourself now that way when that moment does come you're not like what just make sure you understand that bootcamp is there to make you employable you won't just now by default have a job number two bootcamp teaches you how to code yes however they more teach you how to learn and this i don't need to roll your eyes at this because this is actually a really great thing about boot camp because when it comes to developers and getting jobs and software engineers i didn't realize this before i was in it but a lot of people learn what they learned on the job like yes they may have had a work programming language in python and javascript and all of this but then they went out and ended up at a job in front end design in react and now they have to learn on the job and whatnot well by going through a boot camp now you know the best ways to learn now you know you're learning style and you know how what kind of learning process you should obtain to make sure you get the fastest results possible because that's what you did all through boot camp and that's a great great thing that's actually something that makes you more hirable i know when i was going through interviews from my current position that was one thing that my interviewer said he was like oh my gosh you're a boot camp guy we're trying to get more of you here because you guys are quick learners you're hard working and that's a great thing that we want here and so no that's not a bad thing that oh they teach you how to learn like no it's a great great thing and you should actually be excited about that number three there will always be something to do so you gotta be the one to set the boundaries this is something i did not do at all at all who was up at 3am coding lessons and plans and projects out when everyone else was enjoying time in their bed sleeping me because i just became so obsessed with i have to get through this i have to get through this i need to have a job afterwards i need to make this money worth it and so i didn't set those boundaries and it really took a toll on me for those 15 weeks and so no set those boundaries early because a lot of my classmates did i couldn't reach them past like 5 p.m because they set those boundaries of no like after i it is 5 p.m and once i have dinner on the table no that is it my laptop is off and you cannot reach me and i wish i had said that and so no set those boundaries early and often because when you're on the job you'll still need to do that there's always something you can do there's always something to do there's always ways you can make something better there's always something some type of project you can develop and you need to be able to put a line saying yeah there's always something to do and so i know when i wake up it'll be there so yeah goodnight y'all so yes set those boundaries early and often and it will hopefully help you have a more stable boot camp experience number four um no matter how much you say it's worth the cost of an isa it is still going to hurt like crazy when it's time to pay for it and isa is an income share agreement when i was going through boot camp was one of the ways i could choose to finance my time at boot camp because i had a solid 15 bucks in my bank account not 15 000. and so the agreement is they loan you you know in terms they loan you 15 000 and then once you graduate and have a job you now pay them back 10 of your gross income and so it's all sounds great when you're trying to make this transition but then it's time to pay for it and you're like oh my what and so now imagine making a hundred thousand dollars and now every month you're paying them one thousand and so it hurts i'm not saying i regret it or anything because to be honest i wouldn't have the salary if it wasn't for them in the first place you know what i mean but it still hurts uh so prepare early don't be shocked when they come knocking at your door on your first day of work demanding their money back but i have heard some of y'all say that they no longer offer isas i don't know if that's why it's spread throughout the entire nation throughout the entire flat iron school business or if it's different programs i really don't know but yes during my time they offered isas and i'm quite grateful that they did because i wouldn't have been able to go through boot camp if they didn't number five the community you are in is unlike any other community you'll be in ever i truly still think about that community we had while in flat iron school we called ourselves the love bubble it was the most supportive and authentic and beautiful community i've ever been in and i honestly don't know if i'll ever get that again and it's scary to say out loud because i really don't know but enjoy that time because there are very few people who will know what you're going through and that's them that the people around you that's them and that's such a beautiful thing actually because you support each other even more knowing that fact and so really really cherish that really appreciate it because yeah i truly have never been in a community like that and i truly don't know if i'll ever be in a community like that again which is very sad because also i'm grateful i had the chance to be in one number six the first eight weeks go by insanely quick insanely quick but the last eight weeks oh my gosh you feel like you are in the trenches for years four years i think that was more because of my inability to set boundaries and so i would be staying up and doing all these things and then by the tail end of things i was just exhausted so exhausted i just couldn't take it anymore and so time moved so slowly to for me because i was just in such pain now a lot of you i was in such pain and agony and i was like please let this be over and so by making sure you're starting off with sending those boundaries and pacing yourself and just remaining a lot calmer than i did during boot camp hopefully you don't have this experience which is why i'm sharing with you all these things so you can do better than i did but yes the first eight weeks went by very quickly because it's still filled with excitement and it's the newness of everything and all of this and then by the last eight weeks it's like yo i just want a job i just want a job if you can just hire me i i just want a job and so it's just the focus kind of switches and that very much affects your feeling of the time movement during the program number seven they don't teach computer science so the point of boot camps or yeah the overview point of them is to make you employable get you learning about the trending technologies and languages and the popular things to know so that when you go start applying for jobs you are hireable that being said they don't teach computer science and what i mean by that is they don't teach algorithms and data structures which is like quan quote fine depending on the job you're trying to get but where that ends up being a problem is during the job hunt because a pretty popular part of the job recruiting process is the technical interview and so it's really rough having all these skills that you've obtained but you can't really showcase them until you get the job and you're not going to get the job without doing these technical interviews and you're not learning them through boot camps so you have to take extra time away from your learnings and lessons and projects and do that yourself and so prepare for that i if i had truly understood this i definitely would have put time aside let's say 30 minutes a day an hour a day two hours a day at the tail end or middle or lunch or whenever to add that curriculum to my day that way when it's time for me to go through the job hunt process it's not me trying to play catch up and that's not a fun place to be because you're already stressed with so many other things you're still in boot camp you're still trying to pass but you're still now your job hunting on top of it and interviewing and now you're also trying to learn data structures and algorithms and so it's just not a fun time and so let this be a word of warning put that in right now you can easily just go to like leak code and just practice easy things and you're not gonna know how to answer them right now and that's okay that doesn't mean that you shouldn't be practicing them you're not to know right now the first few days the first few weeks but you'll get there you don't want to start you're not knowing when you're trying to get a job that's all i'm saying so yes practice early practice often and hopefully your transition to a job is a lot smoother eight the pandemic will actually make boot camp a lot more efficient and dare i say enjoyable for me i think it made it more enjoyable and just less stressful because now that everyone was online when you were in a lesson and you couldn't have get your code to look like your teachers then your teacher would just be like hey share your screen and now you're sharing your screen and they say oh line 23 you're supposed to have an if statement not a for loop and everything and then boom they go back to the lesson and now you're on the same page instead of being in a classroom the teacher has to walk on over to your desk lean over oh line 26 and then walk on back you know like it was so much more efficient pair programming if you had extra time in your day saying hey who wants to pay a program for the next hour now you set up a zoom link and boom three people are in the room with you it just made things a lot more quick and streamlined and i really appreciated that and i'm especially mentioning this because you know we are still in this parent teacher conference i it looks like that this is where we're really squatting and sitting down and laying up camp and so if that's a reason you are thinking about delaying boot camp or you're unsure about boot camp no actually i think it made things go a lot smoother number nine you can get held back i did not realize this when i was signing up and so when it's first day and they're talking about all of that i panicked like crazy i came like crazy i was like what you can get held back but i'm trying to make a life for myself and so just prepare that now because if i had understood this earlier i would have been able to calm myself down like nia yes you can help get held back like every other thing in your life like high school like college like your job yes you can get help back if you're not meeting the standards for continuing on through these programs of course and so i would have prepared myself that way saying like yes you can get held back and so what that's never stopped you before that's never made you more stressed out before it's just okay i can get help back and so i'm going to make sure to do the work and science he'll deliver it's done and so yes know that if you are failing code challenges and really just not really just not keeping up with things they're not going to keep on tearing you through to the finish line like no they're going to recognize that try to help you make sure that you can catch up but if if you can't like like college if you have all of these f's at some point you can't get to the next class because the next class required you to have a passing grade in all your previous ones and you don't have that and so there's really nowhere to go but home and so yes just keep that in mind well maybe not keep that in mind but just mentally prepare but don't let that cause any angst because like i said that's like every other aspect in your life like your friendships if you're not you know keeping up to par with what's expected of you in these relationships well then you're gonna get cut probably so yeah just don't let that feel too much space in your head number 10 some people will really hate the fact that you went through coding boot camp and they went to college and got a computer science degree yet here you are living your best life even though you didn't have to take the years and tens of thousands of dollars worth to get a degree so keep that in mind well maybe not even keep that in mind but just a little sprinkle of caution there some people really let that live in their head rent free the thought that you went to a boot camp and still ended up where they are but you know at the end of the day that is a conversation for them and their therapist that has nothing to do with you you just keep doing what you're doing i just wanted you to just get a heads up little sprinkle of yeah just there you go number 11 you will not be able to work while going through boot camp so i was in the full-time software engineering program so if you're in a full-time program yes you will not be able to work at all and they say this but i really want to iterate this because maybe you're like me and you're like oh they're just saying this but they don't know me they don't know how driven and how i can make things happen and determined i am no matter what my circumstance and i can have a job i can have two jobs and still knock this out of the park they don't know me no no no um no you cannot you cannot and remember that thing about being held back yeah well your shots of being held back just shoots up if you have a job because now the time that you're spending at a job takes away from the time that you could be learning and so really prepare ahead of time like i moved in with my parents like i moved in with my parents so i didn't have to worry about rent food utilities survival i didn't have to worry about all of that it was really up to them and i really just focused all my mental space on boot camp and curriculum and lessons well yeah you need to identify ways to make sure that you are not worried about those same things during boot camp you can start saving so that once you start you can quit your job you can have this book of savings to support you you can talk to your spouse like hey remember those vows we took yeah well this is the plan so just prepare ahead of time that way no mental space is taken up on stress that doesn't have to do with boot camp because if you've heard me talk up till now you know it was a struggle um a happy struggle a struggle that i am grateful for having gone through but it is still a struggle and you don't want it to become more of one because you are worried about your next paycheck now that being said i know not everyone can move in with their parents and save up money and all of that and so they have options for having let's say part-time bootcamp so that you can go to work or fully self-paced boot camps so that you can do all that but yes if we're going full-time then yes that is my those are my thoughts on that number 12 it literally never lets up it never up i remember reading this tweet once maybe some of y'all have heard it it's like being an adult means saying i just need to get through this week every week until you die that is boot camp that is boot camp you just say oh i just need to get through this coding challenge oh i just need to get through these projects oh i just need to no no girl you just need to get through the next 15 weeks like there's no skirting around it because the next week is gonna feel like this week and the week after and the week after and so stop don't frame your mind like that like oh i just have to get through this and get through this and get to this because then it just feels like you're playing catch-up all the time and you're just running all the time to this like unattainable thing of next week's piece and so instead really just acknowledge where you are right now like yes i'm busy yes i'm stressed but let me take the next hour to walk around the park and enjoy that and just that and then come back to it all and we're back and so yeah really make time to actually enjoy where you are because it's not fun spending 15 weeks feeling like you just need to get somewhere else and then you can be happy that's not a good place to be so yeah word of caution there number 13 you're not going to learn everything i think this is also another misconception when it comes to boot camp of oh i'm going to learn everything that he needs to know and i will then have a job and everything will be sprinkles and rainbows and all things sunshine and that is not true at all with 15 weeks that's not much time at all people don't learn everything in 10 20 30 years of being in this industry 15 weeks is nothing so really their focus is teaching you one thing well so teaching you one back-end technology one front-end technology one back-end framework one front-end framework and teaching you to build yeah web apps and maybe mobile app development and calling it a day there again this is my experience from going through the software engineering program but yeah software engineering isn't just javascript and ruby that's that's nothing that's just like that's nothing so they really just focus on teaching you one thing well so that you are employable for that general thing and that's not a bad thing at all especially when we tie it back to they teach you how to learn because now by knowing that one thing by knowing ruby now you can learn python exponentially quickly because it's a very very similar and now again you know how to learn in the best most efficient way possible and that's a great thing that's a great skill to have as a person and as an employee and so yeah get out of the thought that oh they're gonna teach you everything like no they're gonna teach you one thing well number fourteen near the end is so hard because you can see the finish line you can see the finish line and you're so tempted to be like oh it's right there okay so let me take a breath then boom you trip everyone stampedes past you and now you're at the hospital like like i know that was dramatic but basically yeah it's hard to keep up with the pace when you start seeing that finish line right there well i'm here to tell you keep up with the pace y'all do not drop off there i saw people who had that experience of they were so close and then oh shoot where are they oh they got held back and so that's not you know fun at all so make sure you don't let the fact that you're so close be why you give yourself a more of leeway in your courses in your projects and that you end up not graduating that's not that would be terrible and so just know that ahead of time like yes the end is going to be so difficult to keep up pace but you're so close so keep on going that way you can just run through that finish line and throw your hands up and be so proud of what you've just accomplished so yes don't let up but like word of caution i'm not saying don't take a breather like i've been saying through all of this like no learn to take breathers learn to take time for yourself but still keep up still learn still be motivated don't let being a week away two weeks away three weeks away be the reason you abandon your past process of oh i'm going to learn from these hours and then from these hours from these hours i can have projects and all of that and now saying oh well i'm so close i'm just going to take a nap and watch these shows and call it a day like i'm so close anyway no please please please do not do that and number 15 it is the best decision i will ever make um and i'm saying i because these are things that i wish i knew before boot camp and yes it is the best decision i will ever make at the age of on what what day is it august something august something 2021 it is the best decision i'll ever make it put me on this trajectory i never could have imagined for myself at all at all where i am working at a company i adore i have a salary i never thought of having as a starting salary as a person just gone off college like a year ago it'll put you on a trajectory like crazy and then the people you meet the community you build the oh my gosh it's truly inexplicable and i hope you have that same experience but for me that a thousand percent was mine and so if you know featuring me could have ran down to the me up at 3am stressing about lessons and everything and saying yo you got this this is the best decision you'll ever make i would have maybe taken some time to you know enjoy the outside and you know be happy about where i am instead of obsessing and stressing about where i want to be i would have enjoyed it a little bit more so yes there we go everybody 15 things that i wish i would have known before coding boot camp if you are thinking about coding bootcamp if you're currently going through them i hope this video is able to provide you with some helpful tips and yeah just words of caution and you are able to yeah have a good overall learning experience and so there we have it everybody let me know in the comments which things took out which items stuck out with you most but no thank you so much for coming like and subscribe and i'll see you all later bye"}
