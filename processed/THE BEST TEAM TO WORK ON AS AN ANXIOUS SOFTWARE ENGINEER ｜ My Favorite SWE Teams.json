{"video_title": "THE BEST TEAM TO WORK ON AS AN ANXIOUS SOFTWARE ENGINEER \uff5c My Favorite SWE Teams", "transcript": "hello everybody my name is Nyan I'm the black female engineer I provide content for you and aspiring software engineers and today we're talking about the best team to work on because like that's not something I ever thought about considering when I was transitioning into this space but now that I am a year in and have the ability to think of okay where do I want my career to go and what kind of teams do I like working on especially now that I'm on a different team now it's like okay these are the things I've noticed these are the things that I like the most I like the least and I want to share that all with y'all okay now I started off working at Dreamworks Animation Studios a lot of you will know that already and I worked on the production engineering team this team worked on tools that were solely internally facing what does that mean an internal facing app system process tool is a tool that will never see the light of day it will never see y'all an average consumer a the public it'll never see any of y'all instead it will be seen by those within the company and even sometimes then it's not seen by everyone in the company but just a small subset of people so my team worked on developing tools for artists for managers for people who were making and editing the movies and making sure that all the colors were the right vibrancy and the sound matched with the the characters lips because again they are cartoons they are not just people walking around in this Earth so that means other than the small subset of people no one was seeing the tools we were making now I'm working on a team under Xfinity I'm working on the Xfinity team that works on building iOS streaming apps for Xfinity for those who don't know Xfinity oh I should have done that for DreamWorks as well DreamWorks is an animation studio one of the biggest in the world like movies like Shrek Shrek 2 Shrek 3 I'm I love Shrek so those are the ones I those are the ones I uh share most um when I talk about or when I had spoken about working at DreamWorks fun little game real quick okay y'all what's better Shrek one or strike two we're not even a try with Shrek 3 and Shrek Forever After that that was one also right there were four strategies Shrek one or Shrek two y'all like I'm curious put in the comments let's let's start a war but yes that streamers Xfinity is also a team under Comcast that works on cable services internet services mobile streaming services like what I am working on now although it's only been a couple of weeks it's been like what five weeks working on this team I can already spot some differences between this team and my other team so my other the team as I said internal facing tools and whatnot this team the things they've built and developed the hope is it does reach y'all the hope is it gets out to the public and so that creates a couple different things there's definitely a heightened sense of urgency with each task because of it because deadlines matter way more now before with DreamWorks with my other team deadlines yeah they mattered ah I don't know even that is a stretch for like my specific team because I remember it was like month two or three and I was assigned a buddy on the team please please please if you're on a new team no matter how old you are get a team buddy somebody who is around the same it would be nice if they're the same age as you bezeline is like this the same level as you because that means it's not long ago that they experienced or were like in your shoes get a buddy loved my buddy she had been working Frameworks for about a year a year and a half by the time I came on and she was like yeah my age and everything so it was phenomenal went to my buddy and I was like girl I like don't have much to do day by day like I have things to do but like not much and she was like oh yeah that's how we do things here and I was like what and she was like yeah I know especially since the pandemic the attitude around here is you'll get it when you get it like as a software engineer I get a certain assignment I hear that you have a certain bug you'll get the fix when you get it like we are not saving lives here we're making cartoons why are we stressing out about this we we make cartoons but now and this is like not a bad thing at all know that nothing I'm saying is a bad thing now I definitely see the urgency uh in things this entire week my team has been like running all over the place they have been trying to get things together get things um ready for deadlines and presentations and everything because how long things take directly affect the customer the consumer the public experience with our tools and the public is a lot less forgiving and patient uh here to Mia the manager at DreamWorks using virtual you know and so things are just so much more like a go go however some advantages of being at a team that produces external facing products are one it can be a lot more exciting it can be so exciting working on a tool knowing or feeling or with with the possibility that it's going to be seen by y'all I can say like hey guys if you download this app this very popular app and like go to this tab that page there I created that or that feature that you liked I created that I remember I saw this Tick Tock of the guy who created the undo button on Gmail and he was like that was me y'all and it's so cool being able to say like that's me who's making a difference in your customer in your consumer experience his eye that you've been waiting for and that's so so so exciting and fun and the possibility of that can definitely drive people and so that's for sure for sure one benefit of being at a team like this another benefit is these will likely stay pretty interesting when things are constantly changing because consumers needs are changing and adapting and evolving and you and your team have to rise up to the occasion that can be pretty fun it doesn't need to be this terrible experience this daunting scary thing it can be fun being like Oh okay like consumers are challenging me to like rise to this level like okay Bet and Still I Rise you know that can be really really exciting because when you're on an internal facing team it can kind of get to this place where it's like ah if it works it works like we don't care as much about it being super pretty or being super exciting it's like if it works it works tell us if it breaks but even if it breaks like don't tell us you know you know and so that can definitely be the difference between those two now having your things out there for the world to see can be super exciting however however something you need to think about is the flip side of that because you are working on a team that is producing public products what happens when that product breaks do y'all remember when Facebook and all the 30 000 things they owned broke for like it was a while too it was for like hours it broke can you imagine what being a software engineer for those teams were during those days during that those hours no no no no no no no don't sign me up for that don't don't sign me up for that if something breaks at three in the morning somebody needs to get up and fix that code we can't wait for Monday at nine just because that's when typical working hours are we can't wait for the weekends to end somebody somebody needs to get up out of church take out their laptop and fix this and likely that's the work of back-end developers of these types of teams and that is not something I ever I'm not back in developer but still like that's something to very much consider and the reason this situation really not I'm not gonna say only but typically exists with the public side the external side rather than the internal side is because the products we're working on are only going to be touched by other employees when they're doing their job why are you logging in at 3am on a Saturday go to sleep like why are you logging in right now and so ideally we no one would even know that something is broken until 9am Monday morning and even if someone found out something was broken during the weekend let's say somebody need to catch up on something and they found out something was broken they will relay their findings to the proper team and then we'll go to bed they will not and should not in my opinion expect for for a fix to be addressed immediately and so because of that a life work balance is so much more achievable and attainable and sustained in a team that's more internal facing again it still also depends on the role you have if you are working let's say front end for an external facing tool even if something breaks it's less likely that you're the one who has to wake up to fix it so there's so many nuances to this but overall as a very anxious and I don't know software engineer who gets stressed quite easily um I very much appreciate internal facing teams I do I love it that is home and shoot I'll be bored like I will figure out something to do to occupy my time um and that doesn't mean that I'm not working by the way like it could mean that I'm putting time towards my own professional development I'm putting time towards learning more languages learning more Frameworks going to Tech conferences so I can become a better professional I have the time and ability to do that because I'm in a less demanding space as a person in their early career I really just also love that ability and that space and time to grow at my own pace rather than growing feeling like the world is on fire that's not fun for me so yeah there is what I think is the best team an intro facing team and the next time you're going through the job hunt ask these questions ask what specific tools you'd be working on ask if those tools are interested or external ask what the process is what the operation is for addressing bug fixes and things breaking and who exactly is expected to address these things in what order let me know what other things you would like to discuss what topics what questions what like Observer like let's just chat you know I really that's going to be my tagline from now on for the challenge like let's just chat and so thank you so much for chatting with me and I'm so excited to see y'all back next week bye y'all"}
