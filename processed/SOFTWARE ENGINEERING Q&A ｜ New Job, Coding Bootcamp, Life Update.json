{"video_title": "SOFTWARE ENGINEERING Q&A \uff5c New Job, Coding Bootcamp, Life Update", "transcript": "hello everybody my name is nyan i'm the black female engineer i provide content for new and aspiring software engineers and today is going to be super fun because i am answering your questions if you follow me on instagram you knew you could ask me questions there which i would feature on my qa video if you don't follow me on instagram at the black female engineer but let's get to it i'm going to be reading the questions off my laptop and so if you all see me looking over here that is why but we're going to start off with ronica alexandia who asks how many hours did you dedicate to learning to code and so i primarily learned to code through coding boot camp during my time there i spent about 10 hours a day the boot camp ran from 9 00 a.m to 5 p.m every day so already that's eight hours and then i'll spend another like four hours um still learning still developing still practicing however i would make sure to um like step away and eat um so let's say that's you know two hours for doing that and so it does round it back to 10 hours a day of yeah just making sure that i was understanding and picking up what the teachers were talking about because it's so easy to while you're in the class to be like oh yeah yeah yeah that makes total sense and then you get doing it by yourself and you're like how in the world did two and two make four in this situation how so i really focus on practicing um to do that but to answer your question it was about 10 hours a day going to the next question we have at eat now dot think later i like that they ask if you could redo your time at flatiron what would you do differently i survived week one oh my goodness congratulations each week is a reason to celebrate like y'all this ain't it ain't no joke i think if i could have had certain stopping points of okay from five to six we eat dinner and just watch tv and don't talk to anyone and then we make sure we close the laptop at eight o'clock don't open it back up until you know the next morning make sure you had two hour breaks here i feel like i still would have gotten the same hours of practicing without it being as emotionally strenuous i personally did experience burnout and i um like my mental state definitely took their hits because i wasn't making myself stop because i was just so engulfed with the idea of i will make sure i end this with a job a good pay job and you know all of my efforts off the money going in here will not you know be go to waste however there are definitely right and wrong ways to go about that goal and i don't think mine was always the best way i feel like if i did you know enact certain rules for myself to just make sure that my mental well-being was being of top priority i feel like i still could have done that in a way that still wouldn't give me the same if not better results that i got um i love the results i got i got a job but i'm just saying i don't think like me doing it the way i did is the only way i would have gotten to where i ended but yeah making sure i enact a certain rules for learning and breaks and stops for myself next question comes from benjamin832 and they asked can you do a review on nou camp since the curriculum seems good and it's very inexpensive at eighteen hundred dollars um benjamin are you asking me to do a whole another boot camp is that what you ask and pay eighteen hundred dollars for it is that what you're asking um if that's what you're asking me to do i am so sorry i will not i will i will not put myself through that again um especially if i'm the one paying are you paying the 800 the 18 hundred dollars or am i paying the eighteen hundred dollars um let me know if that's what you mean i could however um try to do some research on it and let you know what the consensus seems to be if that's what you mean i could look into that and i could like try to see um what the goods and bads are that the community says not that i say because again i'm not going through any of that again but yeah let me know if that's what you mean because that's a very uh important detail right there okay so next question comes from at paa.willy20 and they ask which company are you working with so i work for an e-commerce company they specialize in creating websites and web apps for companies in the e-commerce industry and so that's actually why i've been so busy right now i am under two different contracts at the moment one is phasing out and one right now the e-commerce company is phasing in and so i just started there have been training and everything and so i just started there about a couple weeks ago and then i have a couple weeks left of contract one and so i'm in this overlap period where i'm working a lot a lot a lot working a lot so if you see me tired and everything that is why i'm hoping to be a lot more active on social media and everything in a couple of weeks when job one phases out so yeah that's the type of company i work with it's actually different from the company you all will hear me talking about in terms of the job i got after boot camp and you know salaries and things like that because that job is set to start in the summer so in the meantime i've been doing temporary development work for different companies under different you know contracts and everything so i'm very much looking forward to that but yeah until i start that permanent role i'm choosing to keep that um under wraps just you know like fingers crossed knock on wood i don't have any wood knock on wood but yeah okay so the next question comes from comp sci dixon who asks favorite programming language my favorite programming language um i guess programming framework is react i love love love react people who have um damned me and talked um with me about their coding journey and everything know i love react it just like flows really nicely now that being said it took me forever to actually start liking it i just didn't understand it for the life of me for a very long time until i just started just practicing like crazy and it finally started clicking and i just really like the way react flows where javascript things are just kind of like has to go where they go and you just hope things work react has a very beautiful flow to it and i just love it so yeah that's my favorite programming language so next atkincama asks how long did you prepare yourself for your bootcamp and while in it how did you take note i prepared for specifically bootcamp i prepared about a month i would make sure i would be doing you know courses on codecademy like javascript i would make sure that i was also going through their own pre-bootcamp material extensively they provided us with about a hundred hours of pre-boot camp material so yeah i went through that like crazy just making sure that day one i can really kick it off um well because something with boot camp is like once you're behind you kind of like stay behind it's kind of like the mindset people have and they're not necessarily wrong now of course if you're behind one day of course like there's ways you can catch up but yeah once you get to a certain point of being behind it's very hard to catch back up and so i was gonna make sure that i was like starting ahead if anything and then i think there's a second question oh while in it how did you take note i didn't really take notes some people took notes um i learned by doing and so what i would do is while while the teacher was going through the material i'd be coding along the it wasn't it was rarely ever a class where the teacher is just like writing on like a border or like you know just saying things it would most of the time like 90 of the time the lessons would be coding something out and learning while coding and so i would code along that is how i learned best and then after that i would re-watch the lecture two three times to really get that practicing make sure i understood before i moved on so that's yeah yeah that's really how i went through those lessons next question comes from at new nesta who asks what's your favorite animal my favorite animal by far is an elephant i love elephants i am a very sensitive person like so so i'm so sensitive y'all um and so i love elephants because they feel emotions very deeply and they are very family oriented and i was actually born in zimbabwe and so i've gotten to go back and i've gone to ride an elephant and that was just the most amazing time ever like i just wanted to cry the entire time just so amazing so yeah i really love elephants i appreciate that more lighthearted question at modestly underscore magnificent asks how are you liking your job did you contemplate engineering when you were a finance major so so far i like this new job the people are super chill i think like the mindset is more like startup mindset they're not really a startup they have multiple locations but i feel like that's more the mindset it's very chill it's very like do your job and you know come again tomorrow like it's really um fun and chill and yeah the people have been really great in like aiding in that that training and that learning so i really appreciate that and did you contemplate engineering when you were a finance major i didn't okay so here's the thing here's fun fact before i um was a major in finance i was a double major in finance and accounting before i got into that business school i actually enrolled into my college as a computer science major and that's something that's like really funny to think about it wasn't really because i wanted to learn to code it was just like when i looked at the different career paths that all these different majors and all these different you know schools and colleges provided just engineering seemed like the thing that would afford me the life i wanted to see for myself both like day to day and in terms of like financially and you know allowing me to hit certain goals for myself and things like that but it had really nothing to do with the coding it was just like okay i guess you know this wouldn't be a bad life to have but then like a couple weeks later i got a letter that i was accepted into the business school and so i just automatically switched over because that was actually the thing i had wanted really badly and so yeah i had never contemplated it so no it's funny how things come full circle with yeah starting off maybe not starting off but signing on as a computer science student and then four months six months after my graduation being hired as a software engineer so that's it's very funny next question comes from curly shawnee who asks does it matter whether you work at a tech startup or a large company as a first time software engineering job after boot camp no i don't think it matters at all to be completely honest i honestly don't think either is like bad or like good what you have to consider however is which you would be happier with because there's pros and cons with both and i do plan on making a separate video on this in the future so i won't go too deep into it but basically startups as you know a developer at a startup you can expect to wear different hats now that's something that some people may love and may keep some people saying because you're not doing the same thing over and over and over again because with a big company odds are for every little thing that you know that company deals with there's a person for that job i like someone's that at um twitter or at google there is a team a whole huge just for the comments like feature of google docs and so imagine you know being a developer on that team and spending a year just working on the comment box feature of google some people that would just drive them insane but then others you know they like the stability and they like knowing what their day-to-day will look like so i really don't think it matters which one you choose what it'll come down to or what it should come down to is which is best for your personality type and what um you like to see day to day now going to part two of the question do you think software engineering is stressful if so why yeah i definitely think software engineering is stressful and for me it's more because of how nitty-gritty it can feel you have to be so so detailed in your coding and that's something that i see can get me and other people into trouble is skipping those steps of saying to the computer reach here look here do this do that that's what gets people into trouble that's kind of what has in my past has created errors for me and things like that because i'm not being extremely like in my process now that's something that we of course learn i have definitely learned from my mistakes and i have definitely done better but i do find it stressful when you think you are acting in that manner of making sure you are really coding out things step by step and yet your computer is like nah son like i can't find the peanut butter like you said it was in column three where where's column three like it makes things difficult and so it can make things very stressful but also it can be very very rewarding when you can finally say at the end of the day this is the thing i have with my blood sweat and tears with my everything i've been pouring out here is my baby but yeah software engineering is trustful but it's also very rewarding so part three of the question is also how do you remember everything when learning how to code i learn out of habits i think that has really been the best way i learned by not trying to memorize things i think it's better to learn how a process works and know why this process comes after this process in x y and z because i find that with memorizing things that's where you can get into trouble because now you're not actually understanding you're just memorizing and the thing about memorization especially with code is it'll work for that one app you're building but once you switch over to a new team it's not going to work because it's different functions and different inputs in x y and z and so it's more important to know the why behind things because now when you switch over to the team you know that oh i know that when we want to do this we use this because the database works like x y and z and so the only way i get to do that is by practicing and then really seeing how the pieces fit together that's at the end of day was going to carry us further rather than simply memorizing so last question at salsa underscore snob asks what do you enjoy the most about development and what do you enjoy the least the thing i enjoyed the most of development would have to be that amazing feeling you get when something works when um yeah you like type up a line of code and then refresh your page and like you see that element pop up or that design look correct and work correct you just want to just scream in like excitement and just join it just makes like my whole day now what i enjoyed the least is the flip side of that the not working part and specifically how precise things need to be where you you can spend an hour or more going in circles not knowing why your code isn't working and then you look back and see that there's a comma where it's not supposed to be and then boom your whole app is there there you go and you spent hours on this that makes me just like so furious and so mad like i can feel just like the fury running through my veins i just hate it so much but um but yeah at the end of the day it's all worth it getting to see that final product and being able to say like you know what i made that you see that i did that so yeah that's something i very much appreciate and enjoy thank you so much everyone for all of your questions if you're watching this and some questions pop up for you please do not hesitate to dm me at the black female engineer or comment below and yeah let's get that conversation going i love answering those questions for you guys but yeah this is super fun i hope you enjoyed it too and i will see y'all later bye y'all"}
