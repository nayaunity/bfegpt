content for new and aspiring software engineers and today we are catching up we're catching up because i realize and i've known this you know it's not like it just sprung up on me but yeah it has been a hot minute since i've gotten to sit and talk with y'all i really just needed a second a break with you know christmas and the holidays and all that and a lot was happening as you can see i moved yes i actually moved about two weeks ago and so a lot of craziness was happening and i really wanted to you know wait to speak and talk to y'all when i felt like my mind and you know my own being was right uh again and i feel like we're pretty much kind of there so yeah let's talk about what has happened and just some updates for y'all so yeah let's get to it so first things first i have moved i lived in downtown los angeles from like as many of you know from like late july to like just now about two three weeks ago but decided to move a little bit outside of downtown l.a only like 10-15 minutes away and there's so much that came into that decision first of all i always had this like stink with the apartment like like a mental sting like this not liking it too much mostly because of how my moving process went moving into the apartment when i moved in the apartment had not been cleaned not professionally it looked like the other person just you know did their own cleaning so i'm not even like blaming them but then the management never went in and did their own thorough cleaning hired anybody to clean x y and z i know when i watch videos like this limited person doesn't put pictures i'm like brah so i'll put pictures for y'all maybe not all like the terrible terrible ones but like i'll put some pictures for y'all like right around here um and yeah i i remember i moved too well i completely by myself i had these three huge luggage and everything i had been hauling around all day and moved and i had no furniture no nothing and so i get there and i'm starting to see that it's like not that clean like at first glance it was fine so i like got in put my luggage away then went to get some lunch because i was hungry i hadn't eaten all day um so i got some lunch and everything then i come back and i'm talking with one of my friends um hi karen talking to one of my friends we're just like you know catching up and then while we're talking i'm like sitting on like the windowsill i don't know if you remember those like big windows in my apartment how like you could like sit on it sitting there because i don't have any furniture sitting there talking to her and then all of a sudden i'm seeing these like spots on the floor and i'm like and i said like i'm telling her in real time and it's like what like why are there spots on the floor and then this led me to do some more investigating and i start looking around all these different things i start looking under like cabinets opening fridges opening like the bathroom looking all everywhere and i was pretty horrified and i was just like all i have is this air mattress i'm basically sleeping on the floor and it's not even clean what i was really pissed i was pissed um luckily after you know going down to that management office because i used to be a person who kind of zipped my lip and kept it pushing but no not anymore and so went straight down to the management office and told them the situation to show them the pictures i took and was like are you kidding me and so they got um cleaners there i think the next day i can't that whole like week it's super hazy for me but they got clearance there i believe either later that day or early the next day but then that kind of annoyed me because the cleaners come and the management office comes with them like yeah tell them what you want to clean in my mind i'm like everything that like what like what do you mean tomorrow so they were basically told to clean the spots that were in the pictures and i'm just like what so yeah i was always just had this kind of stink about the apartment luckily after writing them you know email about it was like yo thank you for cleaning but this was not okay they gave me that um rent for those like few days back which comes down to like which country's like yeah 250 dollars um so i was like yeah for the days i spent in an unclean apartment in an unclean space i'm gonna need my rent back and they did but yeah since then i just never really appreciated my time at the apartment not never really appreciated but i just always had this like thing in the back of my head because i was like i am paying too much to be experiencing this i i'm if you remember i was paying shoot what was i thinking it was 23 40. we'll see something around there but either way i was like i'm paying too much to be experiencing something like this and so around like thanksgiving-ish i started looking for a place to move into a new place to live and was planning to just sublease my apartment um that way i could leave all my furniture there not worry too much and then hopefully get a place that's furnished so that i just really have to bring my clothes and like my bedding and whatnot and i was able to find that so now i live about 10 to 15 minutes away um i live with roommates and so i spend way less money i save like a thousand dollars a month now also that was another thing i hated living that closely like to my means and i've never paid that much for rent in my entire life before and it just didn't feel great for my soul and so yeah i moved in with roommates um and live in this beautiful beautiful like kind of like townhouse that's like stairs and whatnot um yeah i'm very happy now um not saying again nothing i wasn't happy before but i i can feel it when i wake up like today i woke up and the window was you know letting light in and i could hear the birds chirping and i just felt so really really great um and at peace and that's something i'm very happy to have especially in this new year and what not and so that is my personal uh update and so moving on to things like work so yeah let's see now moving on to the work side of things i still really love my job i will say that i'm very grateful to be with the team that is so relaxed so chill um actually when i let me let me step back for a second because now that i think about it i have given updates about my job on instagram and on tick tock follow me on instagram and tech talk by the way at the black female engineer but i'm realizing i don't think i've spoken too too much about it since my first like one month review one month reflection where first of all thank you so much for all the kind messages i got either through comments or through instagram dms i really really appreciate it there it was very clear that i was not completely good um i was not completely okay and i really appreciate you all for checking in on me and giving me your words of kindness and wisdom and encouragement um and sometimes some of you just a listening ear like some of you you let me call you and we just i i just rent it and i really really appreciate that so let me yeah take a couple steps back to say after that one month by like month two and three oh i felt so so much better it was a complete turnaround because now my boss was back uh my manager was back and i felt like i just had a lot clearer of a direction of what to do in my day-to-day what my goal should be for the next like at least like six months um things to focus on and that helped me a lot i'm a person who i don't do well with ambiguity which i know is kind of depending on certain lines of work or just certain situations can very much be a weakness i completely understand that um and in that case for me it was and it didn't help me a lot in my new job and starting all of this newness the ambiguity i felt didn't help but now i am doing really really great i have been working on a project for the last like yeah like five months working on developing a web app for my team for other teams to use kind of like a managerial task handler web app and it's been amazing it's really like i am one of the main contributors it's really me and this one other woman um on my team we work together and we really just have been doing the damn thing and it has been really great knowing that yeah when i wake up i'm gonna do these tests with the web app and and because it's really from almost ground zero that i started it that i started because it was like almost ground zero when i started that's there we go um i have been allowed so much flexibility in the development process where most of the times to be honest i create my own tickets and buy tickets i mean tasks for the day and whatnot i don't really wait for my manager to say something or my peers or to say something about hey do this do this do this because i'm developing this web app and so i'll be like oh let me add this or oh there's this book let me do this or oh this feature should be added in and it's really amazing having that kind of fluidity and flexibility and autonomy over something uh so big in my opinion and so it's been a really great time now that being said i have been making just plans for what i want my future to look like if you know me um you know i am a planner i like to have a mindset of where i'm trying to go having goals and whatnot and i have seen that for me one of the goals i want is to figure out other ways to sustain myself so see my lifestyle sustain my livelihood and figure out other ways to do that i feel like other generations like older generations it was always just the nine to five like seven streams of income what what um and so i'm working to start building that thing like youtube things like my business about two months ago i established a business for transitioning people into tech specifically when they're in their job hunt really providing that hands-on assistance i don't like to call it consulting because to me consulting is like hey maybe you should do this or maybe we should do this like this is super super hands-on i'm like yo write this article contact this person this person this person and do x y and z so that we can make sure you get from this interview to this interview and so i'm so so excited to start really putting my all in that and also engaging with you all in other social media platforms again instagram and tech talk and whatnot and so i am very very excited for 2022 i feel like it's funny because like i keep hearing these jokes uh man no one's claiming 2022 well i am i am claiming 2022. and it's i've been feeling fantastic so far in my january it's probably one of the best januaries i've ever had to be completely honest with y'all um knock on wood ah mental wood um and so yeah in terms of career both job but also my mindset of the future that is really where i'm at i have a goal of and i'm going to say to you all here so that i am held accountable and i'm like shoot i can't fail now because i said it i'm that kind of person and i have a goal of within like max max max four years but ideally two to three years moving to like moving abroad i'm thinking spain right now and i love spain i've been to spain before and i want to move abroad and just experience life outside of the u.s for at least a little bit and so i'm working on doing things right now to allow me to do that um and be like as happy as i can be throughout that process and throughout that time in my life and so when it comes to career that's where i'm at with things um trying to think what other updates i know some of y'all i caused a bit of a scare not posting for the last like one to two months um i completely understand that i am back i am back you know that uh nicki minaj quote was like yeah it took some i took some time to rest but now i'm back now like that's how i am like i took some time to rest but now i'm back now um so whether you like it or not here i am but yeah i wanted to just take a second to address just the changes that have happened and kind of like say hey y'all it's me again let me know what content you'd like to see in the new year and how i can help you in your new year goals so let me know also is anyone else claiming 2022 like i am if you are let me know below what are your goals or are your resolutions and let's talk about it so thank you so much for joining me i've really missed this to be completely honest i've missed this and i actually posted a video um a few days ago and you guys comments i'm just like oh my gosh i missed this i really appreciate the kind comments you all put under there like welcoming me back i really appreciate it and i'm so happy to be back so thank you so much and i'll talk to you later bye y'all"}
