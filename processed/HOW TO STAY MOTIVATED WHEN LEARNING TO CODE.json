{"video_title": "HOW TO STAY MOTIVATED WHEN LEARNING TO CODE", "transcript": "hello everybody my name is nyan i'm the black female engineer i provide content for new and aspiring software engineers and today we are talking about how to stay motivated while you're learning how to code this is something that can be so so tricky and can really be the thing that stands in the way between achieving that end goal that you set for yourself and not so let's get to it number one have a study plan it's not enough for you to just say you know what i will get to it when i get to it i'll learn and do this new project or do this new lesson when i'm free no sit down figure out when you want to reach your end goal first figure out what you want that integral to be is it a new job is it being accepted into a boot camp is it just creating let's say five portfolio projects what do you want the end goal to be and in what timeline do you want to get there once you figure these two things out sit down and figure out what your study plan should be to get you there how many hours a week a day should you devote to studying to learning to developing to get to that end goal by x amount of months years etc and if you see that oh shoot i'm trying to get here three months from now and i because i have a full-time job and i'm a student at a university x y and z i won't be able to sit down for more than 50 minutes a day and if i do that i'm not gonna get here by three months from now xyz then adjust adjust what your timeline is figure out where in your schedule you can cut certain things back and just go from there but seriously have a study plan because it's going to be so much easier to say oh it's tuesday at 2 p.m that means we're learning something new today and sitting down and doing it being consistent with that is going to be a lot more helpful rather than oh i guess i'm free now like no let's let's not do it number two this is going to sound a little weird but follow coding accounts follow accounts for learning to code or accounts of actual developers doing the thing that you want to see yourself doing and the reason this is important is because when you distract yourself most of us distract ourselves by either tv or social media when you go on social media and you start scrolling and you start seeing people doing the thing that you're hoping to get to it's going to motivate you to put that phone away and pick up your laptop and start learning and continuing on that journey is going to help so much just helping you stay inspired really and there are really great accounts out there both for teaching just going over certain basics and certain fundamentals and things like that and also more of an influencer type but still staying in that development world and i think that can be extremely extremely useful you can follow me that can be your first step follow me on instagram at the black female engineer but yeah start doing that as well number three share your accomplishments this is something that actually i'm very bad at i when i have a new goal or a new project in all of this i tend to keep it very hush-hush not wanting to keep anybody updated on what i'm doing how i'm doing at the speed i'm doing it and all of that until i get to my end goal a lot of people didn't even know i became a developer until after i got the job and it was just like wait weren't you just in my finance class like it was the funniest thing but for me that's just how i operate however don't shy away from celebrating your accomplishments with other people post it on instagram post it on linkedin say today i'm halfway through the 100 days of coding today i just completed so and so project check it out on using this link share your accomplishments because one it's great to just get that positive feedback of people cheering you on saying way to go and it just makes you feel good and more motivated to keep on going and two it also helps other people know that you're now on this journey and when it comes time to job hunt and all of this you're not going to surprise people by saying hey i need a job in software development meanwhile they thought you were still an accountant way back when so it helps a lot for multiple reasons number four this kind of goes with number three and that's tell your parents about it tell your parents or somebody you love and trust and that'll help you in this process because something i've always said is if you want something to get done tell your parents about it because i'm just a person who if i tell my parents about it now it has to get done now i have to get through it because i never want to be the person or the daughter that just says things but never falls through with them that's just something that is not me at all and so when i do cross that threshold of saying oh i'm going to do this i'm going to be this i'm going to accomplish this you best believe is going to be accomplished and so figure out who that person is in your life is it your parents is it your loved one is it your significant other doesn't matter who it is could be your mailman doesn't matter who it is with someone who you trust who you love and respect and tell them about your goals tell them you want to pursue development you want be in so and so company work for google work for facebook tell them your goals your hopes and now when it's time to study and it's time to do x y and z you have this feeling of and not in a bad way but you have this feeling of like i can't let people down because they're rooting for me and of course if you figure out coding and development is not for you then of course leave it behind and figure out what is for you but if you know it's for it still can be difficult to push yourself to go towards this thing to continue on the study plan and so having the back of your mind like these people are rooting for me i don't want to let them down it can help as long as it stays healthy because it can also turn unhealthy very quick so let's make sure we're staying in that healthy mindset and number five know your why know the bigger picture of why you're doing this is because you want to reach financial freedom by a certain age you want to own a home by a you want to simply enjoy your work and be a part of a development team and be a part of what touches so many people every single day and that's developing and coding and just in general technology what is your why for me it was a mix of these things it was partly the financial freedom part but a lot of it was itch this was the first thing that had ever excited me in terms of a potential career and i wanted to chase that to and see where it goes and when i look at the world we live in especially in the united states where there are so many white men in the development roles this often creates problems when it comes to inclusive coding practices what i mean by that is you can sometimes end up with software and end up with apps that aren't thinking about the minority party and i wanted to be a part of the solution i wanted to be a part of striving towards something better and so overall that's my why and your wine needs to be something that's large enough where even on your worst of days where you think you're not good enough where you think you're just not achieving the things you want to and everything because it will happen hopefully not so much but it will happen every now and then and you need to find a way to overcome it the way you overcome it is by thinking about your why so figure out what your why is right now write it down somewhere pick up a notebook whatever write it down and whenever you are doubting yourself whenever you are feeling unmotivated feeling like this is not the path for you look at what you wrote there and please never think that you are not a person who can be in this career just because the people around you don't look like you if that is the case it was the case for me and often that's what would be that's make me feel discouraged making me feel not so great during this process but remembering my why is what got me through this so there you go
