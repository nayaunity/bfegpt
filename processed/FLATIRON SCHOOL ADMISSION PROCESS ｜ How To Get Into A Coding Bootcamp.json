{"video_title": "FLATIRON SCHOOL ADMISSION PROCESS \uff5c How To Get Into A Coding Bootcamp", "transcript": "hello everybody my name is nyan i'm the black female engineer i've write content for new and aspiring software engineers and today we are talking about the flat iron school application and how to really ace it and make sure that you get admitted into this coding bootcamp so let's get into it the first step in the application process was really just filling out that general application i say application loosely because to me it was more of an interest form where you shared your name and why you're interested maybe wrote a couple of short answers for why you're interested and really that was it didn't really take more than 30 minutes if that so after filling this out i remember getting immediate access to some pre-work of theirs just some very um basic things regarding i believe it was ruby that was the main focus at the time i applied in may of 2020 and so getting just some basic pre-work in and really getting that first look into what a day as a flat iron school student would look like within 24 to 48 hours though of filling my you know application or interest form i remember receiving a call or an email from somebody in admissions i i call admissions maybe there's a different non-technical name but yes from admissions from the administration office trying to see if you would like to join their programs and in this conversation i expressed interest and we set up an interview this interview occurred about one week i want to say after submitting that application or after that initial person reached out to me so one week to 10 days after the application itself and in this really what they want to see is that you are passionate about this career switch your passion about coding and also you have done some of the work yourself they don't want to let people in who have never coded anything before typed hello world before and are saying oh yeah i'm going to do x y and z for x amount of months no they want people who are passionate because this is a hard journey and truly the only thing that will get you through it is passion i mean that there's it is passion and love for what you're doing and that really being what carries you through that finish line so they want people who have practiced alone already and so for me i had only really done html and css work and so i had expressed to them that i started building static sites just different projects and started trying to see what maybe family members and friends would want out of a site whether they have a small business or they have a hobby that they want some type of landing page for and i shared that and i shared this is where i'm supposed to be i loved coding you know this aspect and i've been also learning on udemy and codecademy and i really am looking for you guys to provide me that robust structure of learning and they love that's really what they want to see after this i heard back from them if i was going to get a second interview i wanted to say just at most three days after that initial interview and so the second interview was more of a technical interview where you did pair programming with one of their instructors one of their program leaders etc and this was nerve wracking oh my goodness this was nerve-wracking and so that is why you had access to pre-work because they needed you to go through that material get to a certain point of that material and then provide the solution that that chapter asked for provide those solutions to the person on the other side of the screen and oh i it's rough it's rough um not even because you know they're you know mean or hard or anything well it was kind of for me hard you know but it was more rough because i have never done this you know what i mean like i feel like if you're watching this video you've never really done things like this before and so that's what made it the most difficult now the pre-work was in ruby and so did about a week's worth i believe the next interview had been scheduled for about 10 days after my initial interview i really wanted to have enough time to go through all of it i was really devoting everything to the administrator was flexible it was really dependent on how quickly you wanted to go to the boot camp do you want to be in the next cohort or can you wait a month two months three months so that really determined your interview schedule and your application cycle schedule so for the next 10 days i'm going through that pre-work going through the questions to really try to make these solutions and everything and preparing for this interview now how did i prepare one of the things i did to prepare was after i developed what i saw you know as the solution i looked at my code and tried to determine how i would make it better i didn't make it better because then if they asked me how do i make it better well i already made it better you should have seen it yesterday and so i didn't make it better but i tried to determine how i would make it better because i had done some research and seen that that is a question they'll often ask so try to see how i would make it better and this is so important and made sure i could talk about what i just created a lot of times this sounds so simple y'all a lot of times you create something and it just like works and someone asks you okay how did you go about doing this explain this to me you have no idea sir i just hit my computer on the side and it worked i don't know what to tell you so it's really important for you to really understand why the things work the way they do and how you would explain this to a five-year-old a six-year-old there's a saying if you can't explain it to a first grader you don't know it well enough and so really making sure you could truly explain it line by line and yes go through that solution with them and also explain why you chose certain you know variables or certain iterations or x y and z why you chose the solution or the way about getting to the solution that you did now we are at the technical interview and it was just like i had prepared it go through your code explain it to me and how could you make it better now the part that you know was rough was rough for me was the pair programming part the reason they do this is because they want to see that you are teachable that you understand the jargon when they say x y and z that you can easily understand and follow along because yes coding bootcamp is there to teach you but you're going so fast they need to know you come with something something they need to know you have there to begin with because if you don't have certain things certain qualities certain skills you are going to just fall behind so quickly within weeks you'll be just gone so that's why they do this they want to make sure that you are ready for this step if not then maybe take a few more weeks months going through all this and come back to us but that is why they do that especially that pair programming part and so going through that pair programming part it was really just following along with what the person on the other side of the screen was wanting to see um she would ask oh i don't even know she oh let's create this type of innumerable and i'd need to quickly remember what an innumerable was and then go through all of that and so being able to semi quickly follow along do the things that they ask for and show that you are good enough good enough to be here to be in this boot camp right now not in general i'm not saying that there are people not good enough but some people you need more time if you just applied yesterday in your technical interviews two days from now you're probably not very ready and so you want to just make sure that you are ready to start this process and so just going through that and then closing my laptop and being like lord please not gonna lie all i stumbled i stumbled on that pair programming part i truly and it's probably why i can't even remember it that well because i just blacked out i could not i was terrified when i hung up and i had to wait to see my fate because i was like man i i stumbled there it was just that thing of not being sure of what she was asking for me and really just being so hesitant and feeling like she expects me to know that and i do not so so it was very you know iffy on for me but i received a call later that day from the initial administrator and they said i was in that i got a great score and that they would love to have me in their next cohort and so overall that really is that cycle you can expect with fire school i don't know how it is with other boot camps so i really can't proclaim anything i apologize after getting accepted that was when i needed to understand how i'm going to pay for this oh y'all it was eighteen thousand dollars when i went oh my gosh i need to figure out how i was gonna pay for this who was gonna pay for it where it was coming from and so i looked at there many different well i say many it was not many it was three i looked at the three different options i had one was getting a loan one was paying cash my part and one was an income share agreement which i i had been looking at different boot camps at the time and ultimately i chose flying school because one of the brand name i know they have a strong brand name but also because they had the income share agreement the income share agreement what it is overall was the school would relieve me of any payment until i got a job and then when i got a job i would have to pay about 10 of my income every single month until 10 of my monthly income every single month until i paid back the 18 000. i also ended up getting a 3 000 scholarship meant to increase accessibility for women and people of color and so i received that scholarship as well and so my total got brought down to 15 000 and with the 15 000 i didn't have to pay the 500 deposit fee which you had to do to secure your spot for the cohort you want to be in and so after you get accepted things went pretty quickly because you had to figure out how you're going to pay for it and find out how you're going to put this deposit in and y'all i did not have 500 yo i did not have 50 i i did not have so so i was very very happy when i saw i got the scholarship and the administrator is the one who told me about that she sent me the link and i filled it out that day and by the next day i found out i had received it and so they have very quick turnaround and so decided to go for the income share agreement as well i've heard from some of y'all that they don't offer it anymore please let me know in the comments if they don't that would be tragic if they don't because to be honest i wouldn't have been able to go i truly truly would not have been able to go if they didn't have the income share agreement so someone out there for from flatiron is watching this please get that back because it really helps more people get on this career path but anyway received that income share agreement received that scholarship so now i felt relief but that was very fleeting because now i had about three weeks to go through the rest of that pre-work material you still have to go through the pre-work so that you're prepared on day one because y'all you get on day one boom like write x y z code this like it is quick quick quick and so you have about i believe it was about 100 hours of pre-work we had to do before yeah before our first day and so for the next three to four weeks that was a big focus of mine but overall there we go and then you know if this is your first video of mine then you can go on to my flatiron school experience video where i talk about my time at flatiron but that's what the application process looks like please subscribe if you like this video please leave a like and yeah i hope this was informative i hope it was informative but thank you so much for watching this and i'll see y'all later bye"}
