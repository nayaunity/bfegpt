provide content for new and aspiring software engineers and today we are building a website with html and css so let's get right to it so this is going to be the end result of all our hard work just a very simple very clean landing page this could be for anything for your business for your personal brand etc so we're going to start off by defining the doctype the document type and that's html in the language english so that's just the abbreviation en and we're going to add some items in the head first the meta char set which really character set which is utf-8 my bad then we are going to link our css [Music] and so the relation to the html is that it's a style sheet and the href is the style dot css that is what i named the css file if you named your css file kangaroo it would be kangaroo.css next we're going to define the title of the page which is landing page and we're going to do a quick smoke test this is just to make sure everything's linked correctly so i'm going to change the body background color and css to purple and boom there it is and so we know everything is linked correctly now i'm going to just fix this spacing up a tiny bit i like to have last face and to move the head indentation back and now we're getting into our body tag there we go so now we're going to define our first div class and that's going to be top dash banner and we're not going to do anything with it because it's just going to hold an image for us and so we're going to define our next div class and that's going to be main dash section and in main that section we're going to create another div called section dash 2. and so in section 2 we're actually going to create another div because these are our containers and so this next div is for the photo we want to have and we're going to keep it simple call it left photo and so that's that left photo we saw in that preview and so it's not going to hold anything but the image so we'll get back to that and so the next div is going to be right text literally very simple i like to keep everything very simple here and so in write dash text we're going to define an h1 and we're going to say design a personal website that attracts your dream opportunity something you know that sounds legit and then we're going to define an h4 as our subheader which is going to say our free resources reveals the main factors to consider when building your personal website and then lastly we're going to have a button and that's going to say get my free booklet so we're almost done now getting to the next main section which is going to be that list we saw and so this div class is going to be named section 3 and in that div we're going to have an h2 which says what it explains inside it's referring to the booklet we are talking about here and then we're going to have another div with the class name of lyft and within that we're going to create an unordered list i.e a list of bullets and so we're going to do our first li tag we're going to say why building your personal website is the best next step for your career the next list item we're going to say or the the next bullet point is going to say how to create a personal website and be known in your industry for your skill sets so that's the second bullet point the second lift item the third we have i think five in total so the third is going to say how to create a short and long term sorry how to create a short and long term goals that represent your vision and what you want for the future my bad that a is a typo that is my bad i'm not i just noticed it now then we have the best practices for new developers looking to build their brand in the tech industry then the last bullet point the last list item is the top five insights brought to you by talented developers in your community to ensure success in your transition so now i'll give you all a moment to catch up we did a lot so i'm going to zoom out here and let you all catch up you can pause here if you're all good you can fast forward but yeah i'm gonna sit here for a hot minute [Music] my [Music] so now outside that list div we created but still in section 3 we're going to create a div class named photo zoomed in and then close it right away because it's going to be an image we'll grab later and then finally we're going to create a div class with the name main dash section dash button and in this we're going to create a button with the text get my free booklet so the same button we had before just again to you know really urge them to get this hypothetical booklet y'all and then we're going to create our final div of class footer and we're just going to add a simple copyright statement with the p tag with the class name of copyright we're just going to say example company name you know whatever that is and then all rights reserved so i'm going to zoom out show you what the second portion should look like so feel free to pause to double check you have everything i also added that copyright symbol next to example something here i just googled it and then copy and pasted it so you can do the same thing but yes feel free to pause and if we refresh there it is beautiful so we're going to get to the good stuff of finally styling all the links you'll need are in the description box below including this one which is the myers reset we need this to take away all the default styling that our browser implements because as developers that can get in the way of our styling and we then may be wondering why is it not showing up the way i want to etc so you put that in there and then i just comment end of myers reset just to know when my code begins and actually there's a typo there we go there we go and yes it's in the description box below and so we're going to take this image this first image we're going to use that for our first div so we're going to define just some stuff for our body we want the font family to be stand serif and we want the font weight to be lighter which basically just means it's thin text instead of more heavy text as i see the myers reset did all of that pre-styling yep it is all gone now and so we're going to go into our first div here which if you recall was called top dash banner we're going to add that image we just saw so we're going to say background dash dash image url parentheses quotes and then paste that url in there it's in the description box below and so now you also want to define some other properties the size of it you want it to cover the entire div we also want it to not repeat itself if it can't cover the whole dip if it's too small what css will do is create all these recoups we don't want any repeats just the one image and we want it to be fixed which you'll see the effect of that later creates this coral effect while strong while scrolling the width we want it to be 100 so cover the whole page from left to right to cover the whole page and then the height 600px and there it is so now we're going to make the position absolute and we're going to define the z index now making the position absolute and defining the z index which is basically what order we want the dips to appear will show up when i define the next div but basically it's going to make it so that things can overlap one another instead of just appearing one by one so you see how everything disappeared is because the z index here is one so we're saying we want this to show up first and since nothing else is defined then everything else into the background so we'll we'll see it in a second and so it you have to stack the index one two three with the third div being the third thing to be on the screen so you'll see what i mean in a second but with the main dash section class we're defining the padding dash top the position and c index s2 so you see how once i defined the index s2 it popped up yep because we're saying you want this to be the second thing stacked padding top makes it so that the text is a little bit down in the position relative makes it so that we'll later be able to make everything or make two specific div side by side so dot section two display inline block just for that side by side effect margin dash left we want to move 15 from the left so it's going to actually move to the right from the left padding dash top you want it to be five percent so it's going to move down five percent from top to down i hope that that makes sense so we're just yeah pushing that top five percent now we're going to style the class left photo div and so that's the background image we have the url and then the quotes inside the parentheses and we're going to grab this image into the url so that link is going to go into that url and then we're going to do the same thing we did last time defining the background size saying that we wanted to cover everything we want the width to be 350px it's not you know too big and then the height to also be 350. so if we refresh there's our image you see how it's on top of the back of the other image yeah that is what we wanted so now we're saying float left which is also going to contribute to that side by side effect you'll see of the div soon oops there we go and then we're going to define the margin that's right it's just saying hey push it to the left from the right 35px this makes it so that the two divs have space between each other they're not touching and we want the margin desktop to be 10 so move down about 10 see how there's that little tiny space in between that next text and the picture here that's because of the margin dash right and then the float left allowed it to be side by side along with the inline and the things we had defined above now the dot right text which is that piece of text we just saw we want that width to be 700 px going to be a pretty big box you want the height to be 485 px i'm very particular with my height and then we want the background color to be a specific color not just you know red or teal but rgb that stands for red green blue 248 231 and 215. it creates this kind of tan peachy-ish color more more tan but with the hint of peach now we want the color of the text to be this like blueish color so rgb 20 66 103 so yeah this like nice subtle blue here then we want the padding top to be five percent so we want the text to be moved down about five percent and we need the flow to left here too because we want them both to float next to each other so i'll let you catch up for a second if you need to pause here and then we need the margin dash left 35px so let's see what that looks like boom there's our big bot and now we're going to style the text inside so for the most part what you'll see now from this point on is going to be things you've now seen before things we've talked about so it's going to be a bit less talkative and more just fold along when there's something new i'll definitely jump in here and explain to you what that was perfect example is actually right now the line height which we're sending to 60px really determines how far away or how long the line is so if i comment it out you see how the space in between each line is closer to each other if i put 160 px you see how there's a huge space between each line of text yeah that's what the line height does it spaces out each line of text we're also going to redefine the font family because here specifically we want it to be something different it's going to be dash apple dash system and then what pops up in your vs code you just click tab that's all i ever do and then the font weight is going to be 200 so a bit more than the lighter font weight we had to find in the body tag the very first um style we did so a bit more weight a bit thicker than lighter but still not as thick as the default that was the h1 now we're doing the dot right text so the class write dash test which we defined h4 and so that's how you grab certain elements in css if you have you know a p tag or a header inside a class you just add that header add that p tag to the class name so the class name and then p or h1 etc we're going to redefine the font family here as well we also want it to be the apple system see how that looks here and then finally we're going to style that button we just saw so dot write dash text the class name and then button [Music] so here we're going to define the border color because the default is black and so we don't want to see a black border with a blue background then we're going to define the border radius which makes it so that the edges are a bit more curved instead of this cut you know right angle and then just to find the font here and see what that looks like in a moment we're also going to define the border width which is that you know line around the button to one px so that it's a thin line rather than this thick border then we're going to just make the letter spacing 2px which just makes the letters a bit further apart from one another so now i'm going to give you all a moment to catch up i'm going to zoom out and start from that end of myers reset so here's that first half we did and then i'll move on to the second half [Music] so now we're going to style the button some more specifically on the hover what we want the button to do when we hover over it so we want to change the background color to white and the text color to that blue so basically invert those colors and so i'll show you what it's going to look like so now if we refresh when we hover you see how the colors invert we also want the cursor to be a pointer oops to be a pointer when we hover it to indicate that hey this is clickable and then finally we're going to change the transition so you see how quickly it turns into that new color so you want it to be a more slow smooth transition so if i refresh now you see that it's slower yeah because we set the transition to 0.4 seconds so we're saying finish their transition from the previous color to this color in 0.4 seconds the bigger that number is so say one second two seconds the slower the transition is so i'll demonstrate that here so if i say 1.4 seconds you refresh you see how much slower that is so yeah it's a fun little styling feature but yeah let's bring it back to 0.4 and we're good on to section three same old same old [Music] this [Music] so and now we're styling that bulleted list we have i actually liked the styling for this you'll see there's some little things we do that some of you may not have seen before [Music] bye [Music] so now we're going to say that we want the list style type to be none so this just gets rid of the default styling for bullet points but then we'll add those bullet points [Music] back so now styling each list item we want the list style type to be a circle you'll see it's a different circle than a typical bullet point and then we also want the padding left to be 1.5 em em is a kind of a measurement like px but em is more relative to the font size of everything so you can define things with either pxen or percent you see here i used percent a lot i really like that but you see how the bullets are these hollow circles yep that is what we wanted and then we also want the bullet point to be actually a different color so we're actually grabbing the marker itself which is that circle we're going to make it like a brighter orange you know for aesthetic and boom there it is and now we're going to add our last image oh actually this isn't our last image our last image of person is i just called it photo zoomed in because it's that original picture but zoomed in and from a different angle and so you know the drill by now with the background image and all oh and actually i'm realizing i picked the wrong image for that first person image we have so let me yep i picked the wrong image so let me go up and fix that so one second while i it's a very easy fix we're just going to change the link we used the url we used to be of the right image there we go and now we're going to take this url and put it down in that zoomed in there we go and no we can't see it yet because we haven't defined our width and height for it so let's do that now [Music] now we're styling our second button that appears in that main section everything should look familiar so there that was the button class the div now we're actually grabbing the buttons within that div and styling that specific component so [Music] so typically you need the same styling as before border with one key x because you want thin lines and see how thin this line is let's fix a few things let's now style that hover and we should be good for the button [Music] so [Music] so and now finally the footer the footer is where companies will put their copyright information their contact information any links they want but ours is going to be very simple since you know we have none of that we're going to make the background image that previous image in our in our top banner then do everything like before with the background styling [Music] let's take a look and there it is so it creates this look of a natural continuation of our first image and so i just like how that flows together so i really like having a fixed background so let me show you what not having fixed looks like you see that so when it's fixed we're saying we don't want the image to move when we scroll and so it creates this cool effect on this hole now you'll see that styling truly in probably all my apps on my sites because i just love it so much now we're going to do some quick styling for the p tag which is our copyright statement so we're defining the pattern for the top right bottom and left in that order that's what defining padding the way i just did it does so you don't have to keep saying padding top or padding right or patterning bottom and the same applies for margin you can apply all four statements in one going clockwise and all accounted for and then the background color will make it a more navy blue than we've been using a little darker and so we're going to do this so we can see the text that we had put that sentence or that notice of copyright that's why we're adding a background color for the p tag and so there it is so we still wanted that background image but let's also make sure we're seeing our text so i actually want to make some edits to our landing page first i want the list items the very first word in each list to actually be bold and so we're going to do that by putting in the strong tag and putting the word the first word of the list and so we're going to do that for each of the list items [Music] and then we need to tell css that we want strong to represent bold so we're going to just put strong just at the very end here and just say font weight bowl and let's space out the letters a little bit as well so let's do letter spacing 2px and let's see if we refresh and there it is the first words are bold now i also want to make the text just a little bit meteor let's add just another sentence to each bullet point you can really add any sentence you want this is just for stylistic purposes and so let's see i'll just say something like implementing these changes will drastically change your career outlook i'm just going to copy that same sentence onto all of them and then we'll see what it looks like in just a second [Music] and so now we're going to change a couple things in css first that zoomed in image we're going to make it so that there's a boss shadow just to make things a little bit more interesting so we're going to say negative 30px so that the shadow appears on the left 10px and 100px big around the shadow to be and then the color of the shadow is going to be like a dark tan ish color so that's rgb 209 176 so if we refresh and there it is just to add a little bit more subtle color i also see that the margins are not aligned together between the list and the image so we're going to say margin dash top for that image to be four percent so it's going to move it down four percent and there it is that looks about right now we're going to decrease the space between that first and second section so we're going to change the padding top oh and actually there's already padding top defined i forgot so we're going to change it from 18 percent to 13 to just decrease that size see that it's a little smaller just little changes can make all the difference i also want to increase the space between that h2 and the list slash image components so that was in section three so the section three h2 and we're just going to make it so that the margin dash bottom is five percent refresh and boom there's a little bit more space there [Music] and so this is what we have now super simple super just clean oh and actually i'm realizing i actually made two changes off screen that i'm going to fix that i'm going to show you here i changed the line the font weight of that sub header that we saw so i had made the font dash wage to be lighter in dot right dash text h4 so the h4 in the right dash text div i just added font dash weight lighter and i actually did a similar thing to this second title and i changed the font weight there as well so in dot section dash three h2 i made the font dash weight 200. and so not as thin as lighter but not as thick as just the regular text we see and so now everything should look [Music] updated [Music] you"}
