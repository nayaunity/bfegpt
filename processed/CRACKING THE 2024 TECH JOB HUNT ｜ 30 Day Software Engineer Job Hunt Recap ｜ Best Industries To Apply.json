engineer I provide content for you and inspiring software engineers and today we are recapping the last 30 days of my job hunt so let's get into it 30 days ago I set on a mission to get a job in the same amount of time it took me to get a job back in 2020 60 days well we are at the halfway mark day and things are different things are different than what it was in 2020 and I already knew this but I was like oh but me I'm a doer I'm a getter I can and will get everything I want simply because I demand but no but no I have been demanding and I am still in step one still jobless and not in the middle or end stages of any of the roles I've applied to so let's recap let's go over it and talk about what I'm doing for the next 30 days to really ramp up these results so in the last 30 days I have applied to about 160 jobs some somewhere in between 150 and 160 I'll put the number right here but yes not a small amount of jobs for reference back in 2020 I applied to exactly 66 jobs and within those 66 jobs I signed on an offer so now I've applied to about a 100 more jobs than before have gotten less interviews less offers obviously and I'm trying to figure out how to move forward with this so let me break down some stats so this is the amount of jobs I have applied to this is the amount of interviews I have had and this is the amount of second3 interviews I have had and finally here's the amount of offers I've had I've been applying primarily using LinkedIn however ever there's about 10ish roles I applied by simply looking up jobs on Google and going straight to the company site from there to apply this is something I did very religiously back in 2020 but because of linkedin's stature to me it was fine to go through Linkedin for applications now I think for the next 30 days I'm going to go back with that 2020 approach of looking up jobs on Google and then going straight to the job board the thing with this is it takes a lot more time to do on LinkedIn it takes me about 6 minutes to apply to a job to scroll through find a job I want to apply to hit apply fill everything out and submit my application 6 minutes is pretty good that's 10 an hour which doesn't sound great but it really is and so I'm very curious to see how much more time goes by by going the Google approach the first interview I got was within my first 10 days of applying to jobs so I was very excited it was actually Within in my first 10 applications that I even sent out I believe it was actually number 10 and they reached out and scheduled a first round interview with me this process I've been documenting over the last few weeks so if you'd like to see a really stepbystep look into how everything has been and how I've been handling all of it I definitely recommend checking out these videos but yes they reached out for a first round interview we scheduled that had it and I was scheduled for the second round the second round was set to be a technical which is typically expected of a tech job and I studied like crazy I have not touched data structures and algorithms in four years since my last job hunt and even then I did a couple of easy Le code problems and just prayed for the rest um I knew now that I am going towards more midlevel roles these leode eases especially in the stock market were not going to cut it so I C I crammed so hard for 10 days I spent 6 to 10 hours every single day studying studying dynamic programming recursion um memorization matrices I went so ham and now I'm grateful because I feel like I am so ready for other technical interviews but it was a very difficult 10 days because I'm like no I need to do everything I can to get this job so show up to the technical and it is a pretty simple algorithm problem I'm given it had to do with binary search and so I given the extensive study I had done knew exactly how to solve it however have yall ever seen or heard the whole problem of like you can throw a hail mer pass down the field and get a touchdown but you can't do like a just a quick little hand over that is where I was that that's how it felt like I could do crazy amount of like Matrix problems and all of this and and DPS to BPS and all of it but I couldn't I was making the stupidest mistake within this W Loop because I was given such a simple problem and so all to say I did not get that job and you know it's fine I can laugh about it but yes that is how that first job process went now I mentioned I had two interviews the second interview I had is that story is short and sweet they reached out to me saying hey we want to talk to you we want to have a phone call the literal um message they sent me was phone call interview I was like perfect need schedu the time now is the time of the interview I'm waiting waiting waiting for a phone call and I am not getting the call after five minutes I sent the interviewer an email saying hey please let me know if this time still works or if you need to reschedule he sends me back an email a couple minutes later and was like I waited on the call for seven minutes so I ended the call and that is all he said first of all I'm like what do you mean you waited on the call I look look look realized that within the email again labeled phone call interview Buried buried buried was and when I say buried I mean you had to scroll multiple Scrolls through forwarded messages and everything there was a link to a Microsoft teams and I'm like you called this a phone call so I respond back saying I suly apologize for the I don't even know if I said miscommunication or just yeah inconvenience I would love to um reschedule if you would be available never reach back out again he said no that's it which honestly is fine cuz I didn't like his attitude either like you're the one who called this a phone call interview and so I'm waiting for a phone call and then I say Hey where's the phone call he's like I've been on the call so like I'm cool I think that was God protecting me in that moment so that's the recap now for moving forward something I really want to see is if my resume truly is the problem or if we are just in different times where in 2020 companies really started valuing diversity in a way they hadn't ever before and now it's four years later and we're like actually we're cool because there's research to show that black and brown people have been disproportionately affected in Tech layoffs and I'm curious to see how that is panning out in the recruitment process so I actually made a new resume with a name that is more paston Lobster sounding and will not be checking off the boxes that indicate my ethnicity and well instead will opt to say that I am of the white male race and gender now the goal for this isn't to trick a company into hiring me or anything like that it's more to understand where I'm kind of going wrong right now in these first 30 days is it that my resume truly needs true revamping which I truly don't believe that's the case I really love what my resume says and how it's displayed and the stats I have is very comprehensive in my opinion and so if that's true why else am I not getting enough am I like enough call backs for an interview maybe it is just that the market is so tough right now so you really got to be over here to get a job that is you know beginner level or is there something truly happening in regards to how companies view diversity within their teams right now and so in a quest to answer that question I will be conducting this experiment and applying to the same roles that I've been applying to but with this new resume and see which one if either are hit and also applying directly from the company site after looking up jobs on Google another thing I'm going to be doing is focusing on these two specific Tech Industries gvtech and cryptocurrency let's start with govtech gvtech I've been hearing over and over and over again is a lot more secure than all the other Tech Industries and also that they have not slowed down hiring there are also a number of roles within govtech that are willing to sponsor you for your security clearance you don't need to have it upfront so if that is okay with you and you're fine with not having an insanely lavish Tech job gov Tech still pays it's secure and it's still hiring so why not go for it so that's one the second one is cryptocurrency I love keeping up with tech news and Trends via podcast a really good one is hard Fork brought to you by the New York Times and they did a whole Deep dive on how much cryptocurrency is playing a role into this political landscape now hold on we're not about to talk politics however what we are going to do is realize that cryptocurrency is choosing to back up a candidate and put money to a candidate based on their ability to assist them in the legislative fight going on with crypto assets I'm not going to go too deep on it but basically because of the new technology surrounding crypto and its ability to make people very rich very quickly and things like that there are just discussions about how to handle them when discussing trading and the way these politicians and people in financial power choose to handle that could make or break the crypto industry so cryptocurrency companies right now are putting a lot of money towards a candidate who can almost kind of Promise them a happy ending oh that sounds you know what I mean um yes a a good a good outcome now this is where job hunting comes in if they succeed they now have the ability to bring crypto to the masses like no time before and they need developers to make that dream a reality not only developers cuz here's the thing I'm saying this and I bet most of you are hearing me and you're thinking o it's going to be like really Tech heavy stuff or really crazy intricate Tech and skills needed for these roles and I maybe I don't have that so whatever no if you are a front-end developer or a mobile developer you it is my prediction you are going to be looked at so heavy if you are applying for crypto rules and it is because cryptocurrency is such a fantasy and something that is so hard for many people to grasp that in order for these companies to get this product into the hands of the masses they need a front-end developer and they need a mobile developer to fulfill that dream because it's these two types of developers that can make their product very digestible for a large amount of people for the masses the more complex a product is the more money needs to be put in towards developers who can make it simple and digestible again front-end developers and mobile developers so because of this I'm going to be focusing so heavily these next 30 days on those two industries I'm going to still be a applying to the companies we all know and love and also startups and things like that however I'm going to be really focusing on these two in a way that I just didn't in the first 30 days if you'd like me to go deeper on the best companies and industries to be applying to right now in Tech please let me know in the comments below so that is my recap I am very curious to hear what progress or insights y'all have gathered in the last 30 days or at the very least while watching me go through my journey but I really appreciate the encouragement I read all y'all's comments um and it really does motivate me that much more so thank you so much for watching and I'll talk to youall very very soon bye"}
