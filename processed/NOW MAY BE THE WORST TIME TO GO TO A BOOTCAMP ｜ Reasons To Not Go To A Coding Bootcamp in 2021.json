{"video_title": "NOW MAY BE THE WORST TIME TO GO TO A BOOTCAMP \uff5c Reasons To Not Go To A Coding Bootcamp in 2021", "transcript": "hello everybody my name is nyan i'm the black female engineer and today we are going to be talking about reasons not to go to a coding bootcamp in 2021 now if you've seen any of my past videos you know that i became a software engineer this last fall be after going through a coding bootcamp myself however having gone through this and you know having a lot of knowledge of coding bootcamps now in general but also going through a coding bootcamp during a parallelogram like i know certain things that these coding bootcamps might not be telling you and the goal of this video isn't to deter anybody i am just trying to provide information and insights and provide you all with a bigger picture of things that you may not be getting just so you can be more confident in your decisions in a few days i'll be posting a video as to why you should go to a coding bootcamp in 2021 because again we're trying to get the whole picture or you know more parts of the whole so make sure you subscribe so that you can make sure you get that as soon as it comes out so let's get into it the first reason you should not go to a coding bootcamp in 2021 is because it's quite obvious it is virtual y'all and coding bootcamp is expensive which i'm not trying to get into the next point here but if you are paying money for something that was once in a different compa capacity and now it's in this whole new sphere whole new realm with all these whole new rules and from the looks of it i mean correct me if i'm wrong but coding boot camps haven't changed their prices and so now you're paying for a less i'm just gonna be honest for a less real experience but still paying full price but how like how is that fair to be completely honest and so that's something to really think about is it worth getting into tens of thousands of debt and when i when i say tens of thousands i mean tens thousands of dollars in debt for something that you couldn't even get the full experience of when i went through coding boot camp it was virtual and for me to be honest i am a person who prefers to not wear pants for meetings and you know not have brushed my hair for x and x class and things like that and so this worked out very well for me oh but there are so many people that this doesn't work out for especially when home includes your wife your husband your children your mom and your grandma like it gets so hectic and so much more difficult to concentrate on this career shift of yours when there's screaming kids in the background and you know you have people to be accountable for just a few feet away from you instead of being able to actually pack a bag and go to a campus or a school and get your work done for eight hours and then come back it's a lot harder for some people to you know do that and i'll be honest i'm a 22 year old you know woman who does not have a husband a wife children people to be accountable for if you saw my apartment it was just me it was just me in this box it is that's it so again i'm i am in a whole such a different situation than many people are and so it's something to think about when choosing to pay eighteen thousand fifteen thousand twenty thousand dollars of something that you're not getting the full experience of the second reason to not go to a coding boot camp in 2021 i hit on this earlier y'all it is expensive and if you were like me you lost your job you lost a lot of maybe your savings trying to pay your lease trying to pay your loans this that and the other thing because you did not have a job anymore so now you're dipping into savings and you know maybe even taking out loans or all of this to just stay afloat and now you expect me to get on 20 000 debt on top of it no like how how so that is something you really need to consider and of course you're considering it so you know but for the sake of this video and for the sake of full transparency it's something to be very very wary of because if you lost your job that is a very hard thing to put you and if again if you're accountable to people you and your family through now if you do have a family who would be able to pick up the weight and you know pick up the load for the four six eight months that you would be going to this boot camp that's fantastic and that's you know maybe reason to consider it um more heavily um and maybe you can get through this boot camp but it's still a lot to ask even of your partner even of your mama it's still a lot to ask so just keep that very much in mind which you know money y'all i know you all keeping in mind because it's money the third reason to not go to a coding bootcamp is because let's say you do get that job you went through coding boot camp for four five six eight months and you do get a job that's one amazing and very much reason to celebrate but because of the economy right now there is the possibility of your pay being lower than if you had gotten the job out of a panoramic because the company has limited funds now and they have to you know think about x y and z and they have to you know budget a lot more tightly than they would have if all was good in the world and so are you willing to go again into this debt or go through all of these stressors for a job that you won't even be paid as much as you would have if this was a different time and on top of that if you're getting paid less because of this parallelogram the person next to you your co-worker or you know susie down the hall there's a good chance she's getting paid more than you so are you also okay with being maybe the person who's paid the least in the office that's something again to think about if it's worth it or not so the next thing to consider let's say you went through the boot camp your interviews are virtual now they are through zoom through microsoft through higher view all that are you conf are you a person who gets very deterred by not having that one-on-one interaction that human interaction or is this your zone is this where you can actually fly because you're actually an introvert and so having a screen in between you and them is something that can actually make you more comfortable if it's the former that's something to consider maybe it won't be the deciding factor of if you go to a boot camp or not but that's something that during your boot camp you're going to need to practice and really really practice because you could be an amazing person but if that doesn't communicate through a screen then they're going to hire the person where it does communicate because at the end of the day they want to be with people they like i mean would you want to be in an office for eight hours with you know non-stop talking nancy like no like you want to be with people you like who fit the culture who are about the mission statement and everything so if you can't show that because there's a computer and you are in your kitchen with no pants on and all this then that is something to very much think about and practice please practice that's just to that's just a skill and all skills can be built upon and so i'd highly recommend practicing just even do what i'm doing right now talk to this camera right over here talk to a camera just talk to your phone talk to your laptop and just make it feel real and by doing that hopefully when it is time for you know the lights to come on and you to really shine in front of that interviewer for microsoft or twitter for google you are able to do that because now there's actually a person on the screen rather than a dark screen you were talking to for 20 minutes like i am the last reason to not go to a coding bootcamp in 2021 is specifically for people who are married or are in a committed relationship this panoramic has really really tested the bounds of commitment and being in a relationship and you know compatibility and all of that it has really stressed relationships because let's say you aren't able to see them as often because now you're not able to you know go on dates or you're not able to do x y and z now you there's the stressor of household expenses because someone lost their job maybe both of y'all lost your job and it's it's becoming so strenuous to just keep the roof on your head you have that eviction notice you know sitting right outside they can't defect you you know i'm pretty sure right now but it's still not good to see on your fridge you know on you know your door so going to recording boot camp already is such a big stressor i you know was just by myself and you know no real true stressors and still i wanted to just cry cry cry cry more often than i care to admit because it's just so hard y'all it is just so hard and i'll be linking a video as to really how to get through coding boot camp and really get through it as with as much ease as possible but even with these tips it's still hard maybe not as hard as it would have been without the tips but it's still hard and so are you willing to add this other difficult thing to your relationship and just constantly just be weighing it down because you have to think about if you all can survive it as a as a unit if you can't that's like amazing and that's what i pray for that's why i pray for myself you know like that's the goal but i just it matters what your support system looks like and what your household situation looks like because you really can't deal with so much stress on top of boot camp itself because that will impact your success within the boot camp and will also affect whether or not you get a job or quickly post boot camp because if you're so busy with this over here you're not paying attention to here so that is another reason to not go to a cloning boot camp in 2021 and maybe wait until all is up and running in the world again like i said before i'm going to be posting a reasons to go to a coding bootcamp in 2021 video in just a few days so don't forget to subscribe but thank you so much for watching this and i it's it's very hard for me to make this video because i want you all to if you want this life for yourself to become a software engineer to make the switch i want you to make the switch and so it's very hard for me to say these things but that's just the reality of where we're at and i definitely am a person who likes knowing all the information so that i can make the proper decision for myself and so i hope i did that all for you today so thank you so much and i'll see you later bye"}
