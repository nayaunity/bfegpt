{"video_title": "LETS BUILD A WEBSITE TOGETHER! \uff5c HTML CSS Website Tutorial For Beginners 2021", "transcript": "hello everybody my name is nya and i'm the black female engineer and today is a very fun special day because we are going to be developing our first site our first page using only html and css and to make things even more exciting we're actually going to be coding out a replica of one of wix's um websites because wakes you know is a platform for people trying to create websites for their businesses and things like that and so you know they have a whole team of developers to create these templates for you guys and so you know what i want to show that with just html and css we can do just what they are doing and so we'll be coding that out and every single link you will need for this tutorial is in the description box below so make sure you check that out it will specifically have the images we'll be using and a link to one of the code snippets we'll be using as well and so make sure you check that out so let's see it so we are starting right from the beginning everybody so we have our index.html file in our style.css file so just so you all can get you know excited about what you're going to create we are creating basically a dupe of one of wix's templates for websites and so this is the template they have and we're going to recreate this we're only going to do this first half because it kind of goes down a ways but so we're just going gonna do this first half of that but let's get to it so the very first thing you have to do is declare the doctype and in this situation it is html because you know that's the way of the game but um we also have to declare the language which is english then that'll go all the way down there then we need to create the head tag which is really all the information um needed by your browser to convert everything properly to convert your html properly so we need to say what character set is being used which is utf-8 we also need to link to our css and so i think css and then by pressing tab then we have all of that there so the href is linking to style.css and that is the name that i chose for our file because i knew that that would be the default if your cs is named something differently then you'll just have to change that in here into you know flower.css or anything like that and then finally we need the title tag which is what the browser will be named and so let's say wix imitation so very first thing that you should do though is now that the css is linked we need to make sure that the link worked and so we do this hold on before i get there let me make sure we have our body because it's gonna be affected by that so we do this by saying something like body and then changing the background color so background color red if our links work correctly then boom it is red now and so let's make sure let's like really double check yellow boom so whether you started you know developing five minutes ago or five years ago always do these smoke tests to make sure everything is linked properly if we had a javascript file we would also do this with javascript console logging a message and checking that that message appeared in the browser but you know that's neither here nor there because that's not what we're doing right now and so let's look at the website we're trying to imitate so it is divided into different sections so let's call this section one which has more the title of the company section two which has more about what the company is about and then section three which has its own three little sections kind of like a contact us kind of thing social media learn more all that so let's make sure we have those in here so we need name a class and so let's just call this section one for you know simplicity purposes and then do another div so div is yes how we define our sections and then we provide class names and you know id names to make grabbing these elements easier later on when we are trying to style them and all of that let's say additional inflow info boom okay so now let's go back into section one it looks like we have a the title of the company a you know sub title and then a little tiny description so titles are typically h1s and let's say our title be the next great engineer then our h2 our business will be software engineering and then in h3 we can say solving today's problems with let's just make it all fast with tomorrow's technology boom let's make sure that shows up boom okay i'm gonna say boom a lot i do this when i work to y'all so then the who we are section it looks like there's this box right here with you know a little header here and then more information about the company and so because it has a little text box of its own let's create another div and we'll call it intro because you know looks like they're introducing themselves there and so we'll have the h2 and we'll say we are developers driven by the want to see everlasting change and then the other portion was more of a paragraph now i can't think of a paragraph on the top of my head so i'm just going to copy and paste this and i'm going to just indent this this different way just so we can really see the separation of the paragraphs better and so now that is our second section done and if we refresh boom there it is so i'm going to now go into that last section so that last section remember y'all it had three different sections of its own so we're going to create three more divs and so we'll say work and then the next one will be social media social dash media no spaces y'all and then the last one let's say visit us okay so now let me give you all a second to catch up oh i see i'll catch up and i scroll all the way to the bottom [Music] okay so now let's refresh this oh but you know no text was added but speaking of text it looks like each section has its own little box over here and so let's create three more divs inside the divs we just created and so the work one we'll have a div class equals let's just make them all just title we won't put too much information in them and so because they're all the same well because we want them to all be formatted the same oh i cannot spell title i'll have the class names same named the same way that way styling is just so much easier title there and so the title for the first section will be our work then the title for the second section will be social media then lastly h3 is visit us so that's really it everybody like as for html this is really all we need to do so i'm going to give y'all a second to catch up again [Music] so now it is time to style so i went from index to style.css so let's take out this portion because you know we don't want to be blinded by our work today but okay first thing we need to do we need to apply a myers reset so let me go in here myers reset oh there we go and the link is within the description box we're going to copy and paste all of this first in our css because what happens is the browser automatically formats things you did in html for you and so we want to undo all of those changes so that we have full control when we are styling and so i like to add a comment saying end of myers reset just so i know where my code starts and where theirs ended and so comment is created by this slash and star and then say anything you want and then star and slash then that's how you end the comments then you can start coding i used the shortcut of command question mark or the command you know slash i'm not sure what the i think you can do control the control question mark is how you do the exact same thing in windows i'll have shortcuts linked below as well so let's get into the css y'all so let's refresh this yep you see how the myers reset took away all the previous fonting and everything the font sizes and the all that yup that is why we need that so let's say we have the section one and let's tile that first on it just put a section section one so every time we have a class in css we select it by putting a period first so whenever i put a class here to style it i would put period then what i named it this tells css that we're grabbing stuff from you know index.html and so what we're going to do is set it at a height of like 1000 px pixels then let's have for now the background color be black just so we can see some division there let's have the text align in the center and let's see how all of that did refresh and boom the color of our text needs to be white so we can see it so now let's check and boom see that you see that and then everything else is on the bottom okay so let's create some margins so that everything is contained in a certain area so we'll have the margins be of the entire body of our browser the body is literally just everything every section every single thing so and i'll show you why in a second but if you go to index.html see everything we put is within the body so css is no different so when we say margin if we refresh now on the top is 20 pixels and on the sides is 20 pixels okay so now let's see let's have a padding on the top of about 20 percent so we want the text to move down about okay there we go because if we see back in this browser see this text wasn't all the way up here and you know there do you see how the margin looks about the same same here here's the margin and then the text is a little ways down and so now let's make sure we change the size of each of headers within section one and so because we want to change the headers to in specifically section one this is how we say that because if i put something like font size up here then everything in section 1 is changed to the exact same font size but we don't want that so font size let's say 90px then section 1 h2 let's have that be oh let's say 50 50 px and then section 1 h3 let's have it be 35 font size of 35 ps now let's see how that looks boom see that we are getting it together okay now let's do more or less the same thing to everything else we'll worry about the more specific items later so now let's go into section 2 aka who are we so let's go down so let's have it so that the height is also 1000 px then let's make the color white so we can really see which where the last section ended and where the new one begins let's let's see let's see how that looks like for now okay you see that there it is the height looks quite small though what did i say oh i said 100 1000 boom see that 1000 px and so now let's tile the intro if you remember the was where we you know introduced ourselves as a company color is black there we are i was like why can we not see it okay let's make the color black let's make it so that it floats to the right because if you saw here remember how everything was on the right hand side so let's make it so that the same applies here and the width goes all the way across the page so let's change the width to 40 percent so it's 40 of the page and float to the right okay now let's check and there it is okay perfect now the intro had its own items it had an h2 and a paragraph so just like how in section one we're going to specifically target those elements we're going to make it so that it starts a little bit down the page and it's not sticking up to the top like it was we'll make the font size nice generous 50. let's for now see okay see how everything went down that's because we changed the margin and okay things look pretty good there so let's do the same with the paragraph intro entropy margin dash top let's say 20px so it's not sticking to that header font size will be a little smaller since it's you know more text and then let's add text shadows to all of these just so things pop out of the page a little more so we'll make the color black and i'll copy and paste it so that this applies to the header as well so let me give you all a few seconds to catch up [Music] now let's refresh and there it is okay it's really it's really out there but we'll get more into it soon so this is section one section two and you know what let's move this because you see how this is taking all the way to the right let's move that a little more to the left so padding right with 13 do you see what i did i went back to the general intro section and added this styling right here padding makes it so that things move without changing the margin margin is for the outer section here you'll see it better here margin is for the outer section and then padding is for the inside section like here and so if we refresh you see how it moved yeah okay that's better because here you see how yeah it's a little bit more inside it's not center which is why i didn't make it center that's why i manipulated the padding instead okay and now we have our last section which is going to look more like this okay so now let's create that last section which we named additional info so i want to make sure we're all on the same page that is this div right here so we had the overall div for the third section but then in the third section there were three other rectangles in there and then each rectangle had its own little box within so this one is going to you know have more layers than the other ones so we named it additional info right here additional info and so let's see um first let's actually let's keep this here for now because if i do this now it won't make sense so let's keep this here and let's go to the other three sections which was titled work section we see that classes work then social media then visit us so let's go in there instead so we're going to have it so that all of these things have similar um styling and so i am selecting all of them at once instead of repeating things so by doing this we are selecting everything at once so let's have it so that the width of each box is 33 of the page because if you remember here you see that they're all pretty equal so the width is yeah it's right here so let's make it 33 of the page we're using percent so we're sure it's equal sizing and everything and we don't have to go into the specifics of the exact pixels for the size with height we will be specific let's say about 600 pixels and then let's create a margin so that it doesn't stick to the section above it which was section two so let's say 10px which is responsible for the top part of the margin and then 5px is the sides so making sure things don't stick to each other what makes make it so that each of the text is all aligned in the center so text text line center and what's next let's make the font size let's make it a slightly generous 35 pixels the um the color of the of the text will be white and let's see what this looks like so go back in here and refresh let's make the background color something just so we are clear let's just make it to you just so we're clear where we are okay so we see how the three sections were created but do you see how they're stacked on top of each other yeah we can't be having that and so what we're going to do is add this property called display flex justify content center let me double check hold on oh you know what i'm missing everybody here remember i said that this wouldn't make sense yet yeah that's why so display flex and then again justify content center so let's refresh there it is you see that so the reason we have to put it in here as well these items the word social media and visit us they belong in this section and so we put display flex and just right content in this section because we're saying everything else that's in here yeah make sure that everything's lined up if it fits that's what display flex is and then just by content make sure that everything is centered that's why when i put it here the titles moved to the center but then if i put it here then each individual div is moved to the center and is side by side so let's look at it again these are our three sections the next great engineer the info and the like contact us you know kind of page so this is very exciting we're really seeing headway and so now let's fix the styling of the titles within these rectangles a little bit because they need to be a bit further down so dot title let's have margin dash top be 50 so this is going to move it about 50 down let's have the height of the title part let's make it so it creates its own little box with this with a height of 90 pixels and a width of about eighty percent of the size let's make the little boxes background color be black and then the color of the text be white so if we see what that looks like see that so we created little boxes within these large rectangles with a height of width of about was 80 and then the color inside is white so if we go back over here [Music] and let's make sure we justify the content to be centered i'll display flex there we are we need the display flex for this portion because we're seeing now everything within the rectangle let's make sure it's i like to say like let's make sure it's flexible you know what i mean so display flexible and then now let's have it so that the content is centered now that you're flexible be center so let me give you all time to catch up okay now very quickly we're going to add a little part here where we make it so that the title isn't sticking to the top so we're just going to add the padding again title of h3 padding of 30 pixels if we refresh boom now it's not sticking to the top anymore so here is the basic outline we have now so kind of like we're technically kind of like you know there in terms of formatting now let's add the cool features and the cool images to make it really nice and clean so you see how like when you scroll into this wig site it's things look all like they're floating and things are crisp and everything yes let's add that so we're bringing it all the way back up to the top y'all so let's go back up here and you see why i like the comment of end of meyers reset because i know where i was at now so looking at let's start right at section one right over here so let's add a background image instead of just a color so background dot dash image and if you pick up the link i posted in the description just add that here so background image is going to be a url and then you're going to put the quotes and then just paste the link in there okay so background image colon url and then it's going to be parentheses and then quotes and then you put the link and so if you go back into your page you refresh boom doesn't that look pretty boom we're gonna make this more beatable soon but yeah so i used this site called unsplash to get these images so unsplash is great this sounds like you know an ad but this isn't i'm really just trying to teach y'all this um site is great because it provides images that are just so high quality high resolution and they're completely free for use you can add them to your own actual apps and videos and everything and you know you would have no consequences at all for not you know linking them or anything like that so if we even let's say like search restaurant you see how like nice these pictures are and they're always like such large pictures so that they're not you know blurry once you add them in it's blurry to load but not to add them in or anything so i really recommend this and i've linked unsplash below as well but so all the pictures here are from unsplash and so what you do once you find a picture you like you click on it and you can either download it or open image in new tab and then copy the link that's what i did because we're just doing a quick you know tutorial but in other cases i would have downloaded it so no really really really recommend and so anyway anyway to make this more really readable let's add a text shadow to what we wrote in there so it'll be negative 2 then something like this and let's see what happens when we refresh see how that's a lot easier to read it pops off the page more so definitely recommend adding text shadows when possible so then oh well okay this is important so you see how the width wicks when we scroll it has this floaty effect is because the image itself isn't moving it's because it's the text that's moving and so here the image is moving you see that and so we wanted to have it so that only the text is moving so let's add the series of code here so that it looks like that so background attachment is fixed you know you want it fixed to the page background position center just you know just center everything background repeat background repeat it's there because if let's say a certain image doesn't actually fit the page what css what um css will do is basically repeat the image over and over again in the browser but we don't do that we were saying if it doesn't fit that's fine don't repeat it and then with background size we're saying to cover the entire container in this case the entire div and so let's look at what that did you see that cool right right so now it has that floaty effect like the wick sight it has that same float like feel so we're going to add the same thing in the second section but first let's fix our font so let's make the font family be more like a sans serif that's also kind of basic but actually i think fonts is like the thing i'm like most lacking in i'll get better let's say letter spacing so let's make sure each letter in the titles is paced out by three pixels so the letters are merged together so and then let's have it so that the font weight is lighter so we can have it bold so let me show you bold bold looks like this see that and then if we say lighter you see that is thinner so that's what that's doing now let me just add something to background image because we want this to be as readable as possible so let's just darken the image a little bit so we're going to add a linear gradient here and have it be rgb a 0 0 0 which is the color black and then 0.1 opacity then the a again with the zeros because we're doing it black again and 0.3 oh i need another parenthesis boom save that go back in here refresh see how the image is a little darker so now it's easier to read so now let's add this these items to the other sections so let's go to who we are so let's have this background image and this is the photo we'll be using this 2 is linked in the description box we'll have it so same exact things background attachment is fixed background position is centered background repeat is off or no repeat and then background size down here is cover save all of this i'm going to give you all a second to fill that in okay so let's see what that made our site look like oh you see that y'all isn't that cool isn't that cool so i'm going to add a margin so that there's a little space here so margin dash top because we want the margin to be specific to the top of the section 30px now let's look there we are you see that because the width sites yeah each section had its break oh this one didn't huh but i like it better with it we're keeping it sorry y'all let's make the text color white so let's take this out there looks much cleaner and now let's get to the let's see the bottom sections and then we'll be done crazy right crazy crazy so we're going to add a virtual college an image to each of the individual sections so we had the work section dot work so background image will be this link leave the url and then attachment is fixed back on position who's gonna be cinched her ground position is going to be center background repeat no repeat and background size it's going to be cover no not auto cover oops what that looks like there see that so now let's do the same thing with the other items so you can really just copy and paste this down so command cop command paste there the other sections were called social media and visit us and so all we have to do is change the url so that url is this one copy paste and then the visit us url is here you see that we really just did the exact same thing so dot work but we copied and pasted it three times and then we just changed the background image so let's look at our creation look at this look at us y'all wow see that how professional that looks so now this is these are just now little tweaks so you know how when you hover over something that's clickable it's the cursor changes to a pointer or the color changes so if we go into wix's site you see how the color changes to white and now we have the pointer guy over there let's do the same here let's change that here so let's i like making things like grouped together so dot title h3 so let's say dot title hover we want the style to be this when hovered so background color we want it to be black but like kind of transparent so rgb a0 0 0 then like 0.7 yeah something like that let's see how that looks refresh wait how am i saying black my goodness what am i doing because it's already black i meant for this to be here and then this to now be more white white is 250 255 if i recall and then let's do a 0.7 let's see ground let's see what it looks like okay refresh see so it's not like so harsh black now it's you know more taint down okay now let's make sure that the text color changes on the hover so we can still read it color black cursor is a pointer cursor colon pointer very very simple that's one thing i like about css they try to be very simple sometimes they don't succeed i will say that but they try so that's appreciated i don't want the white to be too white let's make it 0.5 to be fresh okay so now if we start from the top this is what we have you scroll scroll and boom one two three so before we're done we're so close i'm just going to change a few things here specifically you see how close these two are matched together yeah i want to change that so go back up here to where we started coding it was section one and these are h2 and h3 of section one so let's make it so that the margin oh margin top 30. okay i'm gonna do a little more y'all let's do 60 and then let's have the h2 have a margin that's top about 15 px boom boom boom oh my goodness i misspelled problems why didn't you tell me that's the one thing sometimes i want actual dialogue you know i definitely want to do a live soon with you all so you can do this all as a little party but for now not yet but there we have it everybody we went from no page at all to this wix imitation isn't that so cool so so cool just like this one go through they have videos instead of images but so excited to have done this with you all [Music] so there we have it everybody i hope you all liked this tutorial and i hope you learned a lot about really how simple things can be with html and css and what all you can create making a dupe of a wick site alone please let me know what you think if you'd like to see more videos like this of tutorials and code alongs and things like that leave a like because you know i won't know what you want from me unless you hit that like button so hit that like button and i look forward to seeing you all soon so bye y'all"}
