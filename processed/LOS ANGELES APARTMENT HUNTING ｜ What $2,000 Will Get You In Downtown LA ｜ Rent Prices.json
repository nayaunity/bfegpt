provide content for new and aspiring software engineers and today we are doing my apartment hunting part two i went apartment hunting in los angeles now about two weeks ago and i've released part one of that video last week so make sure you go check that out if you haven't especially if you want to know what my wants needs budget things like that were make sure you check that out first and then come to this one but this is part two and at the end of this video i'll be revealing to you all which apartment i chose which is also why it's important to go to part one because if it's in part one now you don't know which apartment it is and i'll link that in the description box below but yeah let's see the well first apartment of this video but fifth apartment total [Music] so [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey [Music] so this apartment i'm gonna be looking down at my laptop so this apartment was as you saw a one bedroom i think it's the only one bedroom i saw to be honest with you um but it was a one bedroom 645 square feet at 2485 per month but because of a deal that was going on um with rental prices and i think it was like a one month free situation it really made the price of the apartment really 22.78 prorated 2 278 right away i loved this apartment i loved how just cute it was i think i think that's the right word for it it was just cute it was small but also still high functioning in terms of what it had a full kitchen a beautiful window where it got in so much light hardwood floors in the living room because that actually is quite the non-negotiable for me hardwood floors at least for the main living area i can deal with the carpet in the bedroom but yes main living area really needs hardwood floors but yeah beautiful bathroom and a nice solid bedroom situation so there's really not many bad things i have to say about it other than and i think some of y'all may roll your eyes at this but i didn't like so it's cute i didn't like how cookie cutter it was i didn't really like there was nothing special about it there's nothing special about the unit about the building about the location there's really nothing special about any of it but at the same time that also means there's nothing terrible about any of it really i also didn't like i don't know if you can see it in the video but the view of the window it pointed directly to a shell gas station and so that wasn't the most majestic of things but i could get over it but yeah i think that's really how i felt i was like oh okay cool on to the next and so that is really my biggest con with it but overall i think that's a good thing there's nothing terrible popping out at you but i'm also the type of person who likes to i don't know feel something something some kind of belonging some kind of excitement and there really was nothing here of that but in general it was a perfectly nice apartment so yeah let's go on and move on to the next [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so i really liked this apartment this just blew me away those finishes those floors that bathroom it's just blew me away so this apartment was going for 2 124 it was a studio around 750 square feet and i really enjoyed it however um a very important asterisk here that wouldn't be the apartment i would live in the apartment i would live in was currently being occupied and so i got to see their only their oh the only available unit they had in the entire building and so that's that unit and so that's so so disappointing for me because the idea of moving into a place that i have not actively seen with my own eyes is so hard for me to go through and so in terms of the apartment i would be living in there are a few things that i don't like such as the window i would have in there is interior facing so basically meaning that it's facing the other portions of the apartment building it's not facing the direct outdoor living and whatnot it's facing kind of like a courtyard in some cases a it's actually other buildings and so that is extremely disappointing because if you don't recall you remember watch part one if you don't recall natural light is quite the big need for me especially because i'm going to be focusing on working from home and everything like i i need some sun i i need some sun but in terms of the other things that are on my needs slash wands list i was very happy with the neighborhood very happy with that specific like block it was on it has a washer dryer and unit and very updated finishes as you saw in the video provided there and so overall it's knocked out a lot of things the price is a bit over my budget um but yeah overall it's knocked a lot of things out and note the price i'm giving you is for the apartment i would occupy so the price and the square footage i'm giving you is for the one that i would actually live in not the one that's in the video and so just yeah make sure just to know that but yes there's my spiel and disappointment of that apartment two and so now let's go on to the next [Music] so this apartment to me was quite breathtaking i loved those floors those windows just that wall full of window after window after winter i just loved that so much and it was so cool because the island you saw there in the kitchen you could move it you could move it around you could turn around if i wanted it in my bedroom i would put it there and so it was really cool just like little details and kinks like that i just loved about this apartment it was one thousand nine hundred and seven dollars for 777 square feet so fairly large and fairly reasonably priced for the amount of space i'd be getting compared to other places and apartments we've seen and so i was really pleased with that i think y'all know what i'm gonna talk about next and uh that's the bathroom what was that um i'm not very sure who designed that or who's great idea that was but did you see so basically the layout was you have a toilet here a sink in the middle and then a bath and then a shower here and both have if i'm not mistaken both have their own doors but then you could see straight through each part if you were in any region of the it was just a mess i i was like i fee i felt like i was in i don't even know some type of really old college dorm rooms yeah it felt like it was like a college dorm room type situation it was not cute at all and so i was not a fan of that that layout and also just the bathroom itself i care about specifically bathroom and kitchen those that's really where you can see the age of things you know and that's really where this was shown and that also kind of surprised me because the other parts of the building seemed pretty well updated you saw the kitchen the island the floors things like that it's very clean and updated and not maybe not super sleek or something but it's nice and updated and renovated especially that kitchen and so i was just like did someone not call the bathroom guy did he not show up to the appointment to the party i don't was he not invited like it was just not a fun scene but the building itself is also very historical and i liked that with seeing just these really cool mix and crannies of the building it had a beautiful beautiful beautiful this like library space library space on the rooftop and it had a rooftop um itself which the rooftop itself was fine uh it was fine but that library was truly truly like majestic if only i read no just kidding but i also didn't like the street it was on i understand that with downtown things are dirtier and messier and sometimes like less kept up but you typically know the neighborhoods that are worse than others and this one was part of the not so maybe not the worst but the not so great and so i didn't really appreciate that either and i think y'all who have stuck with me have seen that location is very big with me and i so that was disappointing to see but anyway on to the next [Music] so this last apartment was priced at two thousand four hundred and forty dollars but because of a like again a move-in deal that they were having the rent would come out to 2 315 per month which to me to me it was a bit overpriced now don't get me wrong i did enjoy this space it was 715 square feet and i liked that you saw a clear separation between the living area and the bedroom area so i did appreciate that but i don't know it just seemed a bit over priced because especially because this is the apartment that wasn't downtown l.a it was about 10 minutes out it was around the arts district and so i'm not paying for the location so what am i paying for you know what i'm paying you know what it is that i'm paying for the facilities and services they have let me list this off for you real quick so along with the regular facilities you would expect of any kind of luxury building so rooftop pool gym community room things like that they also offered services i never heard of before for example you could have a personal grocery shopper who would get your groceries for you and the only thing you would have to pay for is the groceries the groceries that's one they had dog walkers also available on demand they also had people available to assemble help you move in or actually put together things for you if you have movers coming in or assemblers coming in and things like that you can have someone come to your apartment from the building come to your apartment and just be there while they're doing that if you aren't going to be home and so they had all these really insane like perks that either cost no additional money or very few they had a very few costs attached to it and so that's that is i guess where the 24 000 24 000 oh my god 2400 2300 comes from but before i bag on the price and everything i did really enjoyed that apartment and so the biggest con with this place really would be again i feel like i know you guys are tired of me saying this but the location it was about 10 minutes removed and it was basically right off the highway which i didn't really like because it didn't provide the most majestic views and everything and so i wasn't the biggest fan of that especially because all my life i've never lived in like the dead smack of things and so i just really want for just a little bit of time to just be in the dead smack of things and so that was the biggest con for me that and i think it's the most expensive of the places i looked at total even with the deal provided it's all all things to consider so which place did i choose pause the video put down in the comments which place you think i chose so i'll wait okay which place did i choose i chose apartment number two of this video of this video so part two apartment two now again y'all know i'm upset that i don't know the actual space that i'm living in but the leasing manager was kind enough to send me a video of the actual space the actual apartment um floor plan it was and so i was very happy about that so at the end of the day it came down to and you're gonna know what i'm gonna say but location i really loved the specific like block the specific block it was on because the location for pretty much all i'd say six of the eight places we talked about here today and last week were all in downtown l.a they're all within just a matter of blocks and minutes from each other but some blocks were just better than others and all of that and so this one was just my favorite block without a doubt and so it came down to that and just the overall niceness and newness of the unit itself and so i'm very excited to be bringing you all along with me as i move i am moving let's see i am moving in about a week and a little under a week and a half that's terrifying but i'm also very excited to be bringing you all along with me on this journey with the apartment move and moving vlogs and empty apartment tours desk setups regular apartment tours and also with comes the move comes the new job so bringing you along with my first day of work and day in the lives and so i'm thinking i mean we'll see but i'm thinking this is when i will finally share with you all where i'll be working and so look out for those videos in the next few weeks but i'm very excited that i'll be able to bring you all along with me i hope you all enjoyed this and please if you did please please please leave a like
