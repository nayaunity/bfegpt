{"video_title": "REAL DAY IN THE LIFE OF A SOFTWARE ENGINEER IN 2021 \uff5c Software Engineer Day In The Life", "transcript": "[Music] so it is 9 47 a.m and it is wednesday and wednesdays i have a stand-up meeting with my company i never really had standups before i started working in tech but basically what they are is either every day or once a week or however many times the company decides the entire team or the entire company comes together to really just inform everybody on what's been going on with the company any announcements and all of that getting the input and then you can have another stand-up with just your team which i also have today later in the afternoon and there everybody in the team speaks on what projects they've been working on anything they're stuck on what's to come in terms of their work and their duties etc and so in the morning i have the company stand up and so you all won't really see me talk or anything i keep my video off because it's the whole company and you know it's really more just announcements so y'all won't really see me talk or anything but hopefully in the second stand up you guys can see just a little bit [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay let me take off my glasses so you don't have to see the glare but i've just finished the company update meeting and i didn't mention um any details about my job i work in commerce cloud development i just started working last month and so for the last i've been going through training going through a lot of readings oh my goodness so many readings i've been going through a lot of readings and so now i'm moving on to going through tickets and sprint work and all of that so that's what today is going to look like me handling these different tickets and everything and so yeah that was the company update it's typically about 10 to 15 minutes long so yeah it's done now i'm so sorry for yawning like crazy i'm so bad at meetings i'm like just i've always been even when i was in high school and i was in lecture i am so bad at meetings where i'm not interacting and so it was that's just i just end up yawning i'm not really tired but i'm just really bad at meetings because but no i'm going to run to the bathroom and then just say a little bit more about what i'll be doing today okay i am back and yes i'm going to be working on some sprint work if you don't know what sprint is i didn't know what this print was before i started being in this industry a sprint is very common in tech it is basically a set amount of time given where the team people on the team work on a specific task and so they can typically be a couple weeks to a month long and so i have about a month's worth of sprint work and so i'm going to work on tackling all of that it's all related on working on their sites their apps and editing different things like headers and search components and things like that so i'm going to be working on different sprint work and i am just now starting sprint work last for the last four weeks i've been mostly working on like i said training and documentation reading the company's docs and really understanding their system processes the framework they use and just to figure out how all that works so i'm going to be working on that i'm going to be jamming some music i wish i could put the audio of the music but it's copy written but i'll be listening to either some burner boy um like a burner boy playlist some aphro beats or some cool like 2000's music like bow wow and sierra so it'll be like a switch between that but in the meantime listen to this non-copy written music [Music] so it's now 1 21 pm and at 1 30 i have a stand-up meeting with my teams and this could be a much smaller group because you know it's just my team so it's going to be about eight of us and all of us will go around say what projects we're working on what we're struggling with and so i'll actually interact this time and not you know yawn or anything like that and so yeah let's see what what ends up happening i can go next um i've been also working on sprints and i got into an issue with my sandbox connecting with everything so i think i missed a step there in the um importing process and everything so going to just redo everything because i think in me trying to fix it i created more problems so i'm going to just redo everything and yeah hopefully it won't take too much time no i'll definitely let you know how it goes thank you okay so the meeting has ended i really just yeah shared that i am having trouble with my connectivity with the different systems we use and so i i had to clone down a repo of theirs and i think something happened i think something happened somewhere in there and so i think i'm just going to delete that entire folder and just redo it all over again so fingers crossed that doesn't take more than just a few minutes so that i can really get going with everything else so let's [Music] see [Music] okay so it is 2 25 p.m and i'm feeling pretty out of it a little bit so i think i'm going to get dressed to go to the gym that way i can just get some blood flowing and then like you know get that rush in and feel better to continue working on after that and so it should only be about 45 minutes and so let me get dressed [Music] so i'm just getting back from the gym and oh my goodness you best believe i am going to chuck this water oh my gosh i can't believe i forgot that i i was so upset when i realized i forgot it but no i'm really glad i went got some blood going got some you know just getting more energized i think you can see that more energized um so now i'm ready to finish up what problems i was having before and so hopefully it doesn't take too long especially now that i have a quick mind and a fresh mind getting at this so yeah let's see okay so finally got everything to look good everything is running well and you know what the best code is working code so now i am going to eat it is oh it is okay 402 i had breakfast at around 11 i had eight this sounds this doesn't sound gross but i had like a green smoothie like spinach and strawberries and like little cuties like tangerines so i'm gonna go eat and i will be right back okay this is my lunch basically it's leftovers from yesterday it was just like a pot dish what was it called i forgot what it's called but it's ground turkey with sweet potatoes yellow onion and yellow pepper it's very good it's very good so oh my gosh yeah i'm way too hungry for this i'm so [Music] now i'm just going to take a break watch some netflix i'm currently re-watching bridgeton i already watched fun fact the male lead is zimbabwean and that made me so happy because i was born in zimbabwe i am zimbabwean my whole family you know is zimbabwean
