{"video_title": "FRONTEND VS. BACKEND DEVELOPMENT\uff1a Which Is Right For You \uff5c Difference Between Frontend And Backend", "transcript": "hello everybody my name is nyan i'm the black female engineer i provide content for new and aspiring software engineers and today we're going to figure out which is right for you front end or back end development so let's get to it so let's start out with what these two people do front-end development is responsible for really everything the user sees and interacts with while back-end development works extensively with databases everything that the user saw and the elements they used they worked because of the back end developer so a typical day in the life that you can expect of the two will start with front end development a ux ui designer has a meeting with their project manager and them to work on how to revamp a site an app or how to create a new one altogether they figure out how they would like the layout to be how they would like the user experience to look like and after they wrap up they bring that report or they bring you know their findings and everything to you and now it's your job to bring their vision to life now moving on to a back-end developer the back-end developer their manager may go to them and say look we need to make sure that our site is running as fast as possible and we need to make sure that our search results that they are as accurate as possible so let's say you work at some type of shopping uh company and so what really they'd be asking for is let's make sure that users when they input in their search box black top shorts the proper items pop up for them and so yeah those are the two days in the lives you can kind of expect of the two different developers so now let's move on to technologies so a front-end developer is pretty straightforward the things that they are expected to know or learn they need to know html and css start there then they need to learn javascript and then finally some type of javascript framework typically react angular or view that's really it that's really all there is to um i mean the languages themselves they are a whole thing but in terms of what to learn and what to know it's pretty straightforward which is not really the case for back-end developers back-end developers they have quite like a slew of options in terms of what languages they're expected to know it kind of goes down to personal preference or what the company themselves use so this can be anywhere from python to ruby to java to c sharp it really goes down to preference and so i recommend kind of trying out the different languages and seeing which ones you resonate more with and going from there now on top of a language they need to know they also need to know some type of database and so really the most popular three options are mongodb mysql and oracle and so yeah these databases are responsible for like let's say a user creates a profile and they have their first name last name age email all of that that information is stored within a database and so that is why that is just such a pertinent part of the role next let's talk salary i was pretty i remember when i was going through this process i was pretty shocked to see quite a salary difference within the rolls so the three locations we'll look at for salaries are new york toronto and london so starting with new york front end developers can expect to make about eighty nine thousand dollars in new york city while back end developers can expect to make an average of about a hundred and twelve thousand dollars these figures were taken from glass door all of the figures were and you see this big difference this stays consistent throughout the different locations so let's move on to toronto in toronto front end developers can expect to make 70 thousand dollars while back-end developers can expect to make 83 000 so not as big of a gap but still a pretty considerable gap now going to london front-end developers can expect to make 000 euros while back-end developers can expect to make 62 000 euros and so pretty consistently back-end developers make more now why is that well back-end developers do obtain a lot more risk than front-end developers a mistake made by back-end developers is much more costly than a mistake made by a front-end developer a back-end developer mistake can cause the site to crash it can cause you know hackings it can just really create a slew of problems that can take a long time to resolve and are just so so costly to the company while front-end developer they don't really have that same risk even if they do you know and when they do make mistakes it's nothing that would be as high caliber as the back end developer typically i mean tell me if you know you're a fine developer and you like made your whole building blow up because you forgot the color of a back i don't know but um yeah it's really not as costly and so you know the greater the risk the greater the reward but at the same time heavy lies the head that wears the king's crown so you kind of need to look at these things but the back end developer may be the right place for you especially when you look at personalities so the personalities of these two developers will start with back end a backend developer is seen as more of a problem solver you know minded person if you've liked puzzles all your life that is a good sign that you'll like back in development however the personality of front-end developers is very detail-oriented you're perfectionist because you care about the look and feel of your project you care about the aesthetics and you care about you know design and just the ability to be more creative one thing i read was that front end development is for people who have always wanted to be designers but never learned to draw which is actually really funny because when i was six years old i wanted to be a fashion designer and so i find that um really funny because i love front end development that is just my niche like put me in coach like that is where i belong um but where front-end developers are very detail-oriented and make sure that things look pretty back-end developers they just want things to work they do not care if they had to throw things onto the wall like as long as it works at the end of the day they will sleep just fine and so um yeah those are just some considerations to make in looking at which is right for you don't forget to subscribe especially if this is not your first video it really helps me out supports my channel and let me know which you're considering more are you more front-end or are you more back-end or do you like a little bit of both and you really don't care what would be the deciding factor for you would be the salary but i hope you liked this video please leave a thumbs up if you did and i'll see you all later bye y'all"}
