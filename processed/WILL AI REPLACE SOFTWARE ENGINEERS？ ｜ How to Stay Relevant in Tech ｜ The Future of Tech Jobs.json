been spending way too much time at home and I figured now would be a really great time to talk about something that keeps popping up on my channels on YouTube and Tick Tock and Instagram I posted this video on Tick Tock a little bit ago about um I was about oh about just saying like hey learning to code can be a great mix for people who aren't um super creative to go freelance rap but don't want to be the corporate corporate and you're pretty much the number one comment I got under that video was like oh well software Engineers are about to be replaced anyways like what's the point and I I'm like okay this needs to be addressed there are some things that one obviously um is scary about the world and climate right now in terms of AI and Tech really great and beautiful and exciting but also in terms of jobs and some jobs like software engineering like developing can be at risk so let's talk about all of it I don't want misinformation to stop people from going towards uh going towards their goals you know so let's get into it this video isn't just going to talk about my own opinions though they like I will state them I'll be okay so here's the first hat for you the US Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory conducted a study with a team of researchers and they came up with the conclusion that by 2040 a lot of software engineers and developers jobs would be replaced by AI there's a high probability that would be the case and the reason I don't think this should scare you at least it doesn't scare me is because Tech is constantly evolving and changing there are so many jobs that were around in the year 2000 that aren't anymore that doesn't mean that those people who have those jobs are jobless it just means that hey if you didn't grow your skills and grow your skill sets and just enhance yourself in order to keep up with the trends then yeah maybe you got left behind but the people who kept on progressing they were able to keep up with the market Keeper of the trends and keep their jobs and get better jobs now when we think about AI a lot of us do think about tattoo petite because that's the you know hot new uh really intelligent thing out right now however other companies are creating really cool experimental items as well for example Microsoft created deep coder which is a highly still experimental tool but it allows for basically what I just said for it to Output true code for the solutions you're looking for if coder can create a whole new application for you by predicting what properties it needs to provide the desired output switches honestly very incredible okay we're intent we're soft passengers or want to be attacked let's Embrace tech let's acknowledge that something's really damn cool something really cool you know what I mean and deep color very much is also oversized commit assistant AI helps developers while they code while developers are programming this tool identifies defects that is in their code overall saving developers up to 20 of their time so I say this to say whatever people are afraid of when we're in it and so let's embrace it let's use these tools because again saving 20 of my time I appreciate it because time is a limited resource and I can't be over here wasting it for you know for no job so how do we use this information to stay relevant in the field and progress and actually end up earning more money because of our learning [Music] okay so so now that we've broken all of this down how can we use this information to be better because if your question is our software engineer is going to be replaced by AI the answer is yes if you do not level up so let's talk about how you can level up and how to change your skill sets or what to learn if you're actually just now starting to code what to focus your efforts on so that you can withstand the test of time the director of AI at Tesla specifically stated how most developers today they collect claim manipulate and label their code when it comes to creating complex infrastructure many aren't doing that basically the answer of how to stay relevant is to lean very analytical and like math heavy or lean very creative let's break this down in the future software developers are going to be very data driven they are going to be feeding lots of data in cleaning data to make sure that their AI tools are very intelligent instead of hard coding their their Solutions because that's what the AI is doing but the AI can work well or smart without as much proper clean data as possible understanding machine learning and machine learning principles along with data science principles is also key is crucial it is key to stay relevant in this field and there's some bad news for y'all and I think for many that's going to include a lot of math AI projects include algebra calculus statistics really a lot a lot of math y'all which I know is such bad news for many people even myself because the last time I took a math class was I sort of got in high school a formal math class I have not taken since high school I'ma need to uh hit up those books a little bit but you know we will talk about that later now on the creative side if you are in ux UI design or engineering this could be a really great time for you because yes AI is super analytical but guess what it's not it's not that creative it's really great at problem solving it's not really great at uh yeah let's create uh the best user experience with these colors and these type of things and everything and believe me I've tried it does not do the best job that's really where my skills make shine so if you are that More Design focused or the want like the creative side of uxcy for example I worked a little bit as a US engineer and I got to work super closely with us UI designers and so if that's if if knowing all of this I need to make a decision for the future I would would likely lead the More usui Design side so now if you've gone through this video and you're not really uh you're not feeling at peace because you're like okay Naya I am not super analytical I am not a huge math person and also I'm not I don't dive head in to design for example that's honestly like me I like the problem-solving side of things but also like escaping from the problem solving side of things doing the more creative side of things and then escape from a more creative side thing to do the more uh problem solving things right AI lacks is creativity like discussed before problem solving and understanding true business needs by positioning yourself as a professional who can look at all those things and create Solutions based on the state of the economy the state of your company the state of your team and what the people users and higher ups at your company need you very much are in a very solid position you will have a secure position here another place where AI lacks is ethical considerations that is really where humans come in because ethics is not black and white and when it comes to computers they are day and night type of tools when it comes to nuances that's really where things can get difficult and so by being that person who can consider all of these things and bring them constantly forward to your team and establish yourself as a person who will constantly look at all these different things to enhance your tools and resources that is going to do amazing for you and if that's already what you do then cool you can you know pop over brewski and call it a day but many people I think no matter where you're at either creative analytical or in the middle like I am liking both things elevation is going to be needed to survive in this Tech space so I say that all to say don't be scared get excited get motivated because if you are a person who isn't um ready or willing to constantly adapt and be a lifelong Learner in general then to me there are better places for you than Tech and that's okay that is completely okay I'm just saying no matter if AI was a thing or not Tech forever is going to be ever changing and so you need to be a person who can change with it and stay relevant in the field I hope that doesn't sound harsh because I sincerely am not trying for it to be it's sincerely it's just like hey let's all level up let's all get that bag and let's all uh that's all learn and grow in the process you know so to answer the question is AI going to replace developers my answer is not if you grow and enhance and level up your skill sets too uh to keep up with these changes people through these Trends this is not something that hasn't happened before like for example the.com bubble back in the 2000s and I'm sure people were left behind however here I am learning to code in 2020 20 years after that and getting a job because I was able to learn the relevant skills needed to uh to be here I promise I will help you all do that along the way the next few videos will be very much dedicated towards being able to secure that position and stay competitive in the field so thank you so much for watching I'm gonna walk around the park a little bit yeah see y'all"}
