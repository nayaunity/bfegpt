What a time to be employed. I started a new job recently for a new startup. I am so excited. The goal is to be building it up with them. So, software engineer, little bit of marketing. You know how startups can be. [Music] So, looks like someone drugg my face across the mat. Okay, so desk is basically brand spanking new now. So, let's figure out how we're going to do this actually. Okay, so here's the vision. Desk. Nia off desk. computer on desk, floating shelves, plants, orchids, lights, etc., and just make it so pretty and dreamy. That's how it is in my head. You tell me in the comments if it turns out well. I'm so scared. So, let's see. I'm going have to be a little handy man for this one. So, let's see. And you may be thinking, Nia, why are we spending so much time on a new desk setup when software engineering is fried? Well, Jessica, I think the future of tech is a lot more nuanced than that. My photo of flaw is thinking that Cloroxing the floor is a lot less energy than breaking out a mop and bucket to mop it. Okay, I need to see where to put the floating shelves. So, the desk is right here. Let me see how big the computer is. Okay. Okay. The computer is this big, bro. The place I put my floating shelves is literally I'm not even going to be able to reach the shelves. Like, okay, so the computer's this big. The computer has a stand. So, the computer is actually going to be like like at least this tall. So, my floating shells should be like there. Hold on. Let me fix the camera so you can see. Like up here, I guess. I mean, how often? How often do I stand at this desk? Really? Not often. Let me if I bring it if I bring it down a little bit. Maybe I just won't ever stand at the standing desk. [Music] Then literally all three of my task rabbits canled and so I ended up buying an electric drill. If I had done this an hour ago, I would be mounting these shelves up by now. But hey, we live. Yeah. No, Task Rabbit. I'm It feels like an app that was built by an intern a couple of months ago with the help of Chat GPT. And I'm saying ChatGBT specifically because Chat is not that phenomenal of a coder. If you want a good coder, go to Claude. Okay, we got it. Let's cuz like I'm I'm ready to be done. I'm so ready to be done. This was supposed to take not much time and I haven't even gotten to see my computer yet. So we What? So what do we do here? Exactly, bro. Ah, I should just read the manual. Oh, or is it this? Oh. Aha. Ah, please. Is it this way? Oh, it's this way. Okay. Is it on? How does one turn on? Oh, is it this, bro? Okay. Ah, what is this? Like, bro, give me some pictures. Give me some pictures. Give me a picture book. Is there no on button? It just turns on. Okay, if you say so. [Music] Oh my goodness. The hardest part is over. There's some shelves over here. Now I can do the fun part. So, let's put together like our whole situation. This better not be something I have to assemble. It's just a mount or like a stand for my computer. Oh, come on. You're lying. Oh, you're lying to me. Oh my goodness. Should we open her up? Okay, let's finally do it. Oh my goodness. How do we turn this on? Oh, here it is. Oh, I'm about to turn it on. Okay, I want to film this though. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. The Hello. To use English as the main language, press the return key. Okay. Thanks, girl. I can use the mouse now. Ooh, the mouse sensitivity needs to be adjusted. My goodness. Okay, while I work on my computer, upgrading and getting it to the migration to work, I guess. I'm trying not to get stressed about it. I'm going to install the like back lights I got for this. Um, I hope there's tape cuz I don't really have much tape. Maybe I could like cut up a bunch of little pieces of the command strips I have. Maybe I'll do that. So, let's see. It's these back lights. It's meant for TVs, but I couldn't find like a smaller one that would like get here in time. Ooh, it has a remote control. Okay, let's see. Okay. Uh-huh. Oh, that's pretty simple, right? We're so close. Like, please. I just want my dreams to come true. I beg. Okay. Uh-huh. Do I have to use all of this? Like, what happens if I What happens if I cut What happens if I cut a piece? Does it stop working? Bro, this is so long. I mean, yes, it's for a TV, but even for a TV, my gosh. Oh, it has the tape. Oh, that's fantastic. It has tape on the back. There we go. Let's see. Wait, that looks so cool. You can't even see it. Do you see that? Can I make it purple? Oh my goodness. Wait, this is actually insane. I just want to put this down here so it's hidden. Oh my. Wow. Look. at that. [Music]"}
