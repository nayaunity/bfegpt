{"video_title": "I HAVE NEWS!!!! Life Update + Catching Up", "transcript": "hello everybody my name is nya and i'm the black female engineer i provide content for new and aspiring software engineers and i am so excited to be doing this video because i've been in quite the limbo um of not knowing what is going to be happening for the next few months and now i have a good amount of answers that i would love to just share with you all so yeah let's just get right into it so first things first some of you may already know especially if you follow me on instagram at the black female engineer but i am moving i am moving and i am so excited because i just really wanted a fresh start i've been living in the midwest for the last like 12 years i spent my childhood in queens so i've been living here for like 12 years now and i went to college nearby and so i'm just ready to just just go somewhere and have a good you know experience and everything so where am i moving to i am moving to los angeles oh my gosh i've been wanting to move to los angeles since before college is actually where i wanted to go for college one because of the weather i am not a fan of the cold like no you can keep that so i'm just so excited to have some sun i'm a person who can very easily be affected by the weather and so just have some sun have some beach have some mountains as well have like really just anything my heart desires and if i want some snow i'll just take a plane back and like go to like i don't know vail or something so i am so so happy to be moving i found this out like four days ago about four days ago i found this out i knew i would be moving for my new job i started a new job in august and so i knew i would be moving but i didn't know where so i got hired by a big company and they have so many different teams so many many companies so many subsidiaries that i had no idea where they would put me what team i'd be on the location i had no clue i worked for a fortune 50 company and so it's that's pretty common with companies that size but yeah i had no idea where i'd be and so i was just kind of sitting here twirling my thumbs just kind of waiting for the phone to ring until yeah four days ago they let me know i'd be in los angeles working in animation and so super excited but also i'm a nervous because i'm like okay gonna be learning some new languages it's okay i got it it's fine especially because i just now um went through that process of going into a job that i didn't know the language and learning and trying to figure things out so quickly because you're learning but you're also trying to help and you know be a part of the team and be a resource to everybody but how can i when i don't know what we're using so that's giving me some anxiety um to think about being in that situation again of being the person who doesn't know for a little bit but i'm also very excited to learn oh my gosh so excited to learn never thought i would be on like when i thought about all the teams i could be on with them to be honest animation never really came to mind we just showed up it definitely should have i just didn't it just didn't come to mind i thought it'd be more on working with their apps and things like that but no i'm so pumped but i also don't have many details right now in the next like four weeks so many things will be answered for me and so i'll provide another update later on on the languages i specifically will need to learn as in the role i'm in and the day-to-day and things like that and i'll also share more as you know as i start working in august and give you more play-by-plays so i'm going to be apartment hunting next month because i already had planned a trip down there just you know it's summer and i wanted a beach and so i decided to just extend the trip and do some apartment hunting as well that way i'm not just like flying back and forth throughout the summer and so yeah let me know if you'd like me to do some apartment hunt videos yeah that's work and then on the another side of work as well for the summer i actually won't be working my most recent job in commerce cloud development i finished also like a minute ago when just a couple days ago finished that as well but i'm sure by the time you also see this some time may have passed as well but yeah finished it not too long ago i decided to just let that be not try to get another contract for the summer or anything so i had to just chill for a little bit i haven't had a summer break in like oh like six years throughout college i always worked in the summer and then i started working when i was 16 and worked throughout the summer so this is something i haven't had in a very long time and so i was like you know what better time than before i start my first grown-up job and so i'm so excited to just get to focus on me focus on projects focus on y'all and just chill take a break for this summer before i start this new stage in my life along with being anxious about the languages i'll need to start learning i'm also kind of anxious about being in la in general i mean vacationing somewhere is quite different i imagine than living somewhere and so if any of y'all live in los angeles please like dm me at the black female engineer or put in the comments just some tips or you know some advice or insights you have to offer because i this is just i i do have anxiety i do have a problem sometimes with maintaining my anxiety and so i'm trying very hard to not just unravel up in here and everything because i am nervous about one being there by myself and of course there's different stereotypical themes people talk about with los angeles and being a person in los and you know things like that and so those are typically are really the things that are kind of making me all flustered like i am right now so i am just going to work on this breathing and just staying excited and just going and just doing it i use i'm a quotes person i love quotes and so i saw this quote that was like do it scared and so that's this one i'm going to do i'm just going to do it scared what's great is this is something i've been talking a lot about with my therapist if you watched my day in the life videos and one of them i talked about going to therapy as i'm very open about it i think it's important to be um given especially given the climate we're in and so it's something i've been going talking with my therapist a lot talking about my anxieties and so the idea of being in la where a lot of people are content creators um or in show biz or you know even now i'm working in quan co entertainment that also gets me you know a little a little flustered and so i'm going to be working on that in therapy over the next few weeks and probably for the next you know a couple years to be completely honest with you if you'd like me to do a video kind of like a black girl's guide to therapy in my transition to therapy and really just a more detailed look into all of that how i found them and all of that please let me know i kind of tried to keep this channel as focused to what i think you all are here for so if you ever want something different or something new please let me know because i'm kind of just like working on what i hear and see around me so let please let me know a lot of what i've been doing lately is trying to figure out how to progress this channel what to talk about what things i should maybe stop talking about what different avenues of things i can explore in terms of like diversification and so one of the things was hoping to do if you all want it is apartment hunts and moving in and like moving vlogs and day in the lives of with orientation week and first week and first month and things like that and just share more instead of focusing most of my time on instructional videos still doing those because i do still like doing those but also putting in a slot for more sharing like this and so let me know what ideas you guys have um because yeah right now it's focused on is going to be focused on my transition into this yeah now big girl big company big city job yeah i just wanted to take a second to just update you all i do mini updates on instagram but i feel like this was too much for me to just put in you know a story or something and too temporary and so i wanted to just provide you all with this and just share and thank you so much to anyone all of you who have reached out and shown your support from me been kind to me i really appreciate that you have no idea how much i appreciate your kindness to me um and so i really thank you for that and i'm so excited for these next few months where i get to just share more with you all especially share more as they um as things come rather than like with boot camp where it's like oh this is what i did x amount of months ago or x years ago or whatever but being able to kind of do things more in real time so i'm so excited to just let that all happen in the next few months but no
