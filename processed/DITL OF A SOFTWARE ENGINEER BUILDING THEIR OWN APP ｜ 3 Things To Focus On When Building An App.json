power I don't have power I have no I have [Music] okay okay I'm going call it good on breakfast I for some reason didn't want much I don't know cuz I love granola and yogurt so here's what we have for today I start my day literally just going over my main goals and one of them is to go outside I did not go outside yesterday second thing is to focus on building out my app something I've really loved about this time in my life is I have the flexibility and like ability to literally just like pick up whatever project I want a a few weeks ago I started building up a dating app with this like pretty hilarious but like also ridiculous concept but I also had a recent idea of like seeing what a specific like BFE app would look like I am releasing the BFE blog in a couple of weeks so I'm so excited I'm really trying to bring back the more like fun chill side of it of like yeah let's just like casually over morning coffee talk about like the real reason why your code isn't working spoiler alert it's you like that just like bring more fun into it so I'm really excited for that and so I'm looking at um ways to actually create or see what creating an app to accompany that blog would look like so I'm going to be building that today yeah and I guess also just like seeing where the day takes [Music] us all right it is too noisy out there a girl cannot think so I'm going be here instead this is insane okay I literally just walked a couple of steps from the balcony to the couch and my chest my heart wants to just break free of its rib cage I am struggling with this elevation there's this one churro place that I love let's find that and head over all packed up oh almost can't forget this cuz I will just pass [Music] away okay so I was going to get a churro then I remembered I absolutely I'm not the biggest fan of shur like I came here with all intent to get one but I got ch I got a chocolate milkshake instead as I mentioned before I been spending a hot minute working on developing apps and that has led me to look at okay what are the steps when it comes to app development I would consider myself a beginner in this regard with this stuff and being so I want to share just some things I no there some things that um yeah I feel like are soft steps and just considerations if you're a person who yeah are looking to develop apps to be deployed to the public that's another thing I'm not talking about just portfolio projects I'm talking about apps that someone may want deployed out to the public so the first thing if yeah you're developing an app by yourself or maybe you and one other person at least for me you have to like be able to picture picture yourself building this thing for a long long time I spent it's not going to take this isn't going to sound like a lot but for a solid seven days every single moment I was awake I was building this app I'm a very impatient person and so I always just want things done as soon as possible and so yeah I really hammered down on it and was just trying to get the peer plane MVP which is my second um tip When developing an app it's so easy to think of the most grand like things that you can include in it so much so that you kind of get start getting lost in it all a big humongous piece of advice I have is when you have the idea for your app that you want to create sit down and literally write out or type out what the MVP to that app is the MVP is the minimally viable product and that is what is the least functionality my app needs to I to like run or like to be done a good example of this is like instacart x amount of years ago somebody had an idea to create a grocery delivery app now they didn't start out trying to develop this insane app that it is now instead they said okay what is the goal of the app it is to align people who want the groceries delivered with Shoppers and yeah get their get their stuff deliver and so what is the MVP of that it is creat creting a platform where users who need groceries can log in or just honestly don't even necessarily need to log in but like can go on explain in plain text what items they need one apple one banana and some cereal in plain text send it off and then that information gets received by somebody willing to shop for those items that's a pretty basic MVP and if you were a person who was starting a grocery delivery app before it was created that would be the number one step create a platform where somebody can input what they need and then a platform where somebody can see what somebody needs and then allow for that process to happen creating an MVP is so important because very quickly you can um get a proof of concept with this very Bare Bones app or platform you're able to start testing and seeing what users think about the opportunity to have somebody shop for their groceries and see what their input is and what IAL um risks or hazards or things that um are getting in the way of that goal and then you can continue developing accordingly and that's what's so great about Agile development it's like okay we just need to figure things out as quickly as possible so let's constantly think of what the MVP is and the second you get that first MVP done think next what's the next level of the MVP and keep going that [Applause] way toward the end of your MVP a good thing start doing is start calculating cost of what it's going to take to have your app run there are some apps that really wouldn't be much cost um but there are others that would be a lot of cost for example for me how was Data being handled and managed having a secure database is probably the most important thing that you can have for your users especially in 2023 and so it's like okay what um can I do to make sure that the users informations and everything if users do need to input information is being protected I started using Firebase which was really really amazing I was actually really shocked at how quick um and easy to use it was but after doing some math and it was free for me to like use it in that um during MVP stage and testing and things like that but I started doing some math and for me to deploy this app and start housing individuals data it it would cost tens of thousands of dollarss a month and so I was like okay how does one get such and so that's where looking at other funding um options is so so necessary they are really amazing opportunities and incubator programs that um take people who are creating have created um seemingly amazing apps and work with them to hopefully see it through success an example of one is combinator I'm pretty sure many of yall know about that program and it is extremely um like competitive but at the same time it's filled with the brightest Minds out there Sam Alman from Chad GPT it can be just absolutely just an insane opportunity if that's something you're interested in definitely check out the applications and apply and then another way to get funding is um reaching out to VC firms um on your own and pitching your idea or to individual investors and pitching your idea and in the fourth reaching out to friends and family and pitching your idea and seeing if anybody who has the extra funds to Doo would be willing to um fund your idea in exchange for some Equity okay so it suddenly got dark so I started walking home and then I was like wait a minute I didn't get any food for dinner and when I had that thought I saw a taco place we like okay cool let me order the second I ordered it started just pour okay we made it with very few drops on us so let's go I'm at starving did I order one taco okay I could cry I am so hungry okay okay you know what it's fine it's fine it's fine I'm going to order I'll order some door Dash they call it R rappy here Robie that's what I'll order I'll microwave this and we will move forward oh my God oh my gosh okay okay I don't have power okay we're okay um I don't have power I don't have power I don't have power I don't have power I have no I have okay okay let me reach out to my host and okay I only have like 37% of battery so I need to conserve this oh my gosh am I going to die oh my goodness I have one taco I have water and I have 37% what do I do hey it appears I don't have any power Okay so I will eat a cold as Taco it's fine I'll put some lime juice on it my laptop is at 2% one thing at a time I'm going to put some lime juice on this I want to eat it so I'm less hungry and I'll just go from there okay well not much is happening wow wow what what a plot twist this is fun I'm having a great time okay here we go oh my gosh it's so cold it's so cold it's good pretty salty actually wo wow that's actually really salty I sat here ate the Taco homeboy still hasn't responded so I double texted and said please advise at which point um I think the translation isn't amazing but he was like how do you think and then okay I'll see that right now I think the proper inference of this message is like oh like oh really you think so um okay I'll I'll see to that right now should I find a cafe to work from if they have Outlets like a Starbucks and I saw Starbucks oh but it was so far that Starbucks was so far it was during my walk that was wild the second I clicked stop recording the lights went on the second oh I'm so mad I didn't get that on video ah I'm so mad I didn't get that okay cool oh thank God it just turns off again okay let me charge everything I own right now okay okay that was funny and well I can say that cuz I'm sitting here with the lights on and my charging I need to order some food and I kind of want to just like chill for a little bit um so we're coming on to the end of our day let me figure out food and hopefully enjoy this light someone's knocking I don't want to answer it it's like a buzz let's see if they bu Buzz again let me see if my let me see if my host like sent a message no let me let me also not be in line with the door I don't know okay let's see my Airbnb host is typing okay he just double checked if everything's okay like are the lights on is the Internet working it looks like the internet was working fine so let me tell him that but he had he didn't say that he's buzzing or that he's the one at the door I don't like this now I'm thinking I should just like keep the camera rolling 24/7 cuz the second I stopped filming something else happens how annoying is this by the way it's just frames that's annoying and it like it's not only just frames it has the like plas IC wrapping on it okay I think everything's fine oh my gosh okay I would have never guessed today would have been distressful I'm going to order myself the like best meal I want to treat myself for the ups and downs of this day and I'm going to get a nice big thing of dessert yeah that's what we're going to do so let's let's do that ah and now I'm afraid to stop filming because watch someone like I don't even want to say it whatever whatever it's fine it's fine we have our food I got some pastas just some bolog um I think that's how you say and um teros sou for dessert I feel like that's a good Comfort pickme up type of dinner so yeah let's go digging this is one grain of past oh my goodness this is a family of four type of feast [Music]"}
