engineer and today we are going to be talking about the fastest quickest easiest way to become a software engineer in 2021 now i'm sure if any of y'all have looked outside some ish went down between january 2020 to march 2020 because of this and this sudden influx of jobs and companies moving to online a lot of demand has shown up for software engineers and web developers to be able to assist in the migration of companies from in person to online and not even in the migration but also being able to build upon the current systems in place because now it's one thing having let's say 10 people you know using your platform but now having a thousand people using your platform because they have no other choice now when we think about even smaller mom and pop shops let's say food trucks and coffee shops and things like that all of these different places have now needed to find a way to gain an online presence gain in online branding in order to sustain their business because again we're all up in this house it's now companies large and small needing to find a way to sustain their online presence and being now much more willing to hire web developers than they may have been in the past because maybe they thought it was unnecessary and all that so let's get into it so the first thing you want to do to become a software engineer in the quickest time possible is learn the bare bones of the structure you will be building and what is that that is html and css html standing for a hypertext markup language css standing for cascading style sheets these two things come together to create really a basic site with html being really the text that you see on the site so when a header on the site when you see a title when you see paragraphs or quotes or links that's html now when you see that the page isn't just a white page background with this black text on top of it as a title as paragraph as links that is because they're using css css is responsible for the styling of things and to be honest people like to sleep on css people like to very quickly just breathe by it thinking that it's not going to make a difference or it's not as important as you know javascript and ruby and react and all of this stuff but y'all it really is because you know what when you submit your portfolio for a company when you are now building that app building that website what's going to make it look pretty css y'all when was the last time you went to a site and you decided to like oh no i'm getting out of here because it looked all kinds of messed up yeah that's css y'all so you want to make sure you really put in the practice with that to really make sure that at the end of it all what you have spent so much time building looks nice and pretty and sleek and clean and all of these things that make audiences and consumers and customers gravitate to that site to that app to that business so do not sleep on that y'all like seriously spend hours days weeks really honing in on css because that's another thing it is so hard to pick on on css than the other languages and frameworks because the other languages and frameworks have like a clear right and wrong css y'all yo once you do one thing you think you're changing the background color but then you're changing just this little box in the corner and then you think you're changing the font size only to this and it goes haywire so being able to really hone down and continue practicing css is so so necessary when it comes to html html y'all is quite straightforward it is quite straightforward it took me a night if that to really learn html because it comes with its own very clear set of rules if you want a title make sure it's marked with this if you want a paragraph make sure it's marked with this and there you go go on your way and work good and also it's very googleable and so you can definitely get away with knowing less html because if you need to you know create a chart in within your site now you can just google how to create a chart in html and boom there it is but first step you need to know the bones of this structure bones of this house you need to be able to build a real nice structure and that is with html and css so now you know html and css and so now you can create static websites for people for friends family when i say static website that is typically just a landing page you go google i don't even know pets.com and you just see a website with just a bunch of pets pictures some names of the pets and all of this and that's it there's no you know adoption type service there's you know buying things for your pet at home or anything there's no service being produced or accessed or anything like that it is what you see is what you get you go on go off and so now you are able to build a static site and so if you can take about a day or two after practicing html and css css in particular start building some static sites think about your hobbies think about things that interest you and create a site for it just you know one page try to make it have a banner try to make it have different images and you know different borders and things like that and just try to make it as pretty as possible and if you can do that you're in a very very good spot so just get that practice in don't just rush and learn and then go on your day you need to make sure you get your practice in with actual projects because that is how you test your abilities and that's how you will be able to become a software engineer in the quickest time possible so the next thing you need to do this is i want to say yes this is number three you want to learn javascript so so when it comes to web development the three things you will really really hear most talked about are html css and javascript now i like to use this you know other you know simile of you know what where html is the person you're dating css is the way they look and javascript is they act the way they treat you put all these things together and you have your perfect or not so perfect person so these three things together you have really a lot under your belt as to web development especially front end software engineering front end web development because now you're able to create the content of a site you're also able with css to style it and with javascript that's what creates the actions and so being able to say when i click here it's going to do this and when i swipe here it's going to go here and this is going to change this is going to javascript is how things change within the app you are creating so it is very very important and it is what differentiates between just a site and an app an app it has functionalities it has resources it has services it can provide it has you know actions a site is just chilling there just you know there it is you what you see like i said is what you get but then adding that action adding that functionality that is when you can now actually do something with your app whether it be an e-commerce site whether it be a social app all this stuff that is where that magic happens so four the next thing you need to do to become a software engineer in the quickest this rapid-fire possible is learn a back end technology so you just heard me talk about front end just now so front end and back end these two things together is what creates an app and so front end is what you see it's what you can actually trace and being able to say okay this did this and when i clicked here it did this and these colors are this and this these words are here that's front end that is what the user actually interacts with back end it allows for content to be fed to the front end and so back and when you hear front-end and back-end engineers one way back-end works is to provide basically storage for data and so if you want your app or site to be able to say when i click here i want to be able to see all of the cities with the name that starts with the name b and so all you have to do is click the button b cities and there it pops up well it pops up because of what was stored in the back end so these two things communicate to each other to ultimately provide a service or a result to the user and so i highly recommend learning ruby as your first back-end technology ruby is extremely easy to read it was made with the thought of simplicity while also being highly productive specifically when joined with ruby on rails what's ruby on rails ruby on rails is a library or a framework built upon ruby to really allow developers to build apps in the easiest way possible being able to provide ideally everything the developer would need to provide the app with everything they want really like ruby on rails it's extremely daunting at first if you just look up ruby on rails and you see all the files and all the folders and files within folders and folders and files it is can be so so daunting to look at but when you start seeing how things connect and why this folder exists and this file exists and where what goes where it becomes so much more manageable and becomes such a smaller world and less of this big daunting place so i highly recommend learning ruby and then ruby on rails learn will be first y'all like you're not going to be a successful software engineer by skipping steps so it's very important to learn the basics or the the vanilla okay you know it's like this y'all learned long division before being handed a calculator correct it's the exact same thing here because now even though you have the calculator you know what the calculator is doing you the process of dividing is if you just start with ruby on rails it'll be i'd say very difficult in the future for you now maybe you are able to make an app but you don't really understand how you understand how to you you were able to do it because you followed a tutorial you followed some you know udemy course or this that or the other but you don't really know why it worked and it's so important to know why it worked because when you become an engineer your boss says hey do this this is this you need to know why things work to know the best approach to solve a certain problem you need to know how things connect with each other how things go from here to here for you to be able to go into a certain program go into a certain project and fulfill that task for your boss so please start with ruby first just ruby itself the language before going on to that udemy course and following along this ruby on rails tutorial and i say that because y'all the amount of udemy courses i bought i want to say i bought six of them and sure i was able to build things and it was cool once i did but yeah i didn't know the biggest clue about why this worked and if you asked me to do it by myself i may have been able to do it because i memorized the steps but i don't know why i did those tips because i wasn't learning for myself i was just following along and so please learn ruby first learn how the language is structured again it's very very easy very very readable and then go on to ruby on rails so now with these things html and css javascript and ruby on rails you now have every single thing you need to create a full stack web application this is major this is truly truly major because you can now actually with just these things create an actual like social media app you do now it's a matter of how do we translate these quon quote more basic skills into hireable skills one way and one very important way is to now learn front-end frameworks so ruby on rails was a back-end framework now let's learn front-end frameworks because while javascript is very very important for the front-end people aren't using javascript so now when i say javascript i mean vanilla which is the term of you know the long division type of javascript people aren't using long as i say people aren't using long division they're not but people aren't using vanilla javascript to create their apps they're not because we have front-end frameworks to allow us to do things quicker and provide us with the necessary tools and functionalities to create these nice big sleek functional apps in a much less time and so learn a front-end framework i highly recommend react or angular or view these are all frameworks based on javascript and so now you've learned javascript so now let's make sure that your frameworks very much you know correlate with javascript so because again we're trying to do this we're we're not wasting any time like we got to be quick here we're trying to get that bag as we're in a panoramic like we need money now and so these three frameworks are very very highly utilized within companies within startups within large tech firms they are very very highly utilized and so you want to be able to build with these frameworks to now be able to put on your resume like look i do you use react great so do i so you want to be able to say that and again don't be daunted when i say things like frameworks and you know dictionaries and libraries and functionalities like all that all i'm saying is get a calculator in your hand and now just learn how to use it and it's going to take you know a little bit of time to use this calculator but now everything you do is going to be so much faster so much high-tech and so much more transferable to other companies when you're trying to get a job so please like i know it's a lot of just spillage on all you but please breathe that's all i'm just saying grab a calculator now that you have learned html and css javascript a back-end technology hopefully ruby and ruby on rails and now you have learned a front-end framework let's say react and you know view or view or angular now go to your friends go to your family try to find someone with a very like a hobby they're very much into or a business that they just started or you know they've been doing for a while try to find a friend or family member who has either a business of their own or a hobby that can very much be shown online a hobby let's say your friend is um an artist and so go to them and say hey i noticed you know you're a very talented artist and i bet you've thought about selling your products let me create a site for you let me create a web app for you an app in general let me create something for you and i want you to be able to use it this is a great way to get your practice in one and also add things to your resume because now what's going to happen get a pen and paper because i'm very serious about this you go to your friend ask them to build a site or an app for them they say yes now you too need to sit down and you need to hear and take notes on every single thing that they want their site or app to encompass what color schemes do they want what kind of field do they want do they want it to be sleek and clean and uncluttered or do they want it to be like really in your face really busy and you know fun and you know all of this what vibe are they looking for what's their target customer their target market because that also affects you know color schemes and fonts and all of this and everything then ask for deadlines then when you go back to you know your own house your own office your own bedroom draw some markups for them and go back to them and say here after these conversations we had i drew up three to four designs for how your app will look like which one do you like more these designs will have let's say like the layout with you know if we want a navigation up here and then we want you know the columns down here and then a chart here and things like that just draw four different iterations of that then when they pick one go back and start building the app for them keep them updated and make sure you are following the deadlines that they set this is amazing practice for when you get a job because that is what a job is a company expects you to be able to take their vision and produce it they want somebody who can take an idea and turn it into something real something real something tangible something they can actually see and so by doing this and practicing this with your friends and family people who will not you know fire you or you know maybe fire you but still keep you on as a friend slash you know daughter or son like now you are able to get practice in not only developing but also get practice and following i want to say direction but i don't want it to sound as if it's like like falling orders more of a thing of being able to take someone's vision and put it to actuality because it's very that's something that's very difficult because we are people who have our own styles our own way of doing things and so being able to actually take some something that somebody wants despite our own opinions or views or anything and still produce something that both of us are proud of that takes tremendous patience and skill and discipline and so you want to practice this as much as possible and if they end up using what you created for them if your friend if your mother if your brother end up using this or even better yet paying you for it now you can put it on your resume as experience because you know what you were just a freelance developer for them and for their company and for their business which is he huge and companies don't take that lightly it is so so important i got hired just off projects i didn't even have you know experience to say oh no a company hired me to do this and i did it so now imagine if you can put that on your resume and talk about it during your interviews that will be huge so there you have everybody the quickest way to become a software engineer in 2021 do these things and really really devote time to it and you can become a software engineer in six months or less and it takes discipline it does it takes being able to draw boundaries with your family and friends and you know being able to have actual like working hours dedicated to your school dedicated to your self-teaching journey and really really come out of this the other side with something you're proud of a job your own business your own company anything like that so it takes discipline but if you do have that discipline you can do this by by the summer y'all you can be a software engineer so thank you so much for watching please subscribe below and like and comment and let me know what other videos you'd like to see from me but for now i'll see y'all later bye"}
