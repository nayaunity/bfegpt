{"video_title": "HOW TO PICK A CODING LANGUAGE IN 2021 \uff5c The Best Coding Languages To Learn As A Beginner", "transcript": "hello everybody my name is nyan i'm the black female engineer i provide content for new and aspiring software engineers and today we are going over how to pick a coding language specifically your first coding language as a beginner programmer and you really just have no idea where to go when you're picking your coding language there's definitely multiple approaches that you can take to get to that first language one of the approaches you can take is figure out what career you want to end up in if you are trying to learn how to code odds are you're looking to at some point get paid for your work and get hired as a developer as a software engineer and do some research into what career paths are out there in this field then when you find a career path that resonates with you your personality your experience and really just what you want to do in the future then let that lead you to the coding language because not all coding languages are transferable between careers so i'll provide you with a few insights into what coding language you may choose based on the career you want to be a front-end developer your track in terms of coding languages and frameworks to know is extremely direct it is a straight shot road and really what you need to learn is javascript learn javascript paired of course with html and css front end development deals with what users see when they are on an app on a web app and it deals with how they interact with the platform and that interaction piece is where javascript really heavily comes in so there's front end if you want to be a back-end developer what i really recommend is choosing either javascript again javascript or c-sharp or python python is great because it is very beginner friendly often dubbed as the easiest programming language to know and that is great because it can just do so so much and actually can be beneficial throughout so many different career paths so you really can't go wrong c sharp is not as beginner friendly however it is very very on demand in terms of the job market and so if you can find your way to be a great c-sharp developer you will not have troubles finding a job and then javascript is great if you want to do full stack development front end and back-end development because if you recall that was the language to learn if you want to be a front-end developer well javascript is also great for the back end and so if you know you want to do full stack or you're undecided between front and back end but you know you want to do web development again javascript you really can't go wrong if you want to instead go into 2d game development again javascript comes in here and c sharp javascript being dubbed a bit easier to learn than c sharp but again c sharp being so on demand in terms of the job market now say you want to be in game dev but not 2d you want to be in 3d game development so really the languages to go for would be c sharp or c plus plus it's recommended that if you want to go this route to actually start with c sharp and then glide into c plus plus because c sharp is harder to learn but c plus plus is also not for the weak and so going this direction of c sharp two c plus plus it will just provide a better learning curve a much easier learning process for you and then number five data science or machine learning if you want to do one of these two things it's very much recommended that you go for python which is great because again it's easy to learn and so that's just a sneak peek into what languages you can learn depending on the career path you're looking to take however i'll make sure to add some articles below that really goes in depth into all the career paths and all the different languages coinciding with them now say you don't know what you want to do and that is okay you don't know what you want to do but you know you want to be a developer of some kind honestly just pick a language just pick a language throw a dart at the wall see where it lands and go from there truly truly i'm not i i'm being dead serious so pick a language and devote time to it make sure you devote time to it because it's very hard to get a sense of language in just a few days so say something like okay i'm going to make sure i devote myself to python for the next one to two to three months and then make decisions after that this allows you to really learn the fundamentals of the language and then after that time period is over see and ask yourself okay how did i feel during this learning process did i like the language did i not can i envision myself continuing to use this on a day-to-day basis at work one day and let that guide your next decision and honestly just keep rinsing and repeating until you feel that you can see yourself with this language on a job one day i had picked python as my very first language and nagala it didn't take me long for me to abandon it not because i didn't like the language more because in terms of my learning it was very hard for me to stick with it because i didn't get i didn't understand when i would use certain things i understood if statements and all these different ways to go about programming python but i just didn't understand what i would use it for and how i'd use it how i would use these if statements and things like that and so i was learning how to program learning how to code but not understanding how i would be a developer in this role if that makes sense and so i ended up actually switching to javascript html and css because i loved that immediate gratification i got when i changed something when i changed a color from red to blue and then when i made sure that on click this happened i loved that immediate gratification and so that's why i say i didn't choose like the career the career chose me just because i loved learning these things and that coincided with a career in web dev but no do not be afraid to keep on trying different languages again and again because there's really no loss in it even if you see that you don't resonate well with python well when you start working or when you're on the job hunt and you see a job that says oh we want a web developer that has a little bit of experience with python well now that is you and so don't see anything as time wasted or lost in any way because it really still carries with you some type of benefit that you may not see just yet now let me just say this because this is something i did not know for a very long time there is a difference between a language and a framework i made the mistake of jumping into frameworks not even knowing that there there was a difference right jumping into ruby on rails when i didn't know any which way what ruby was like truly truly had no idea and so make sure you understand the difference a language is simply put what is used to write programs while a framework is a set of tools used to make development especially development of larger applications just a much easier process something i've said in the past is is the difference between long division and using a calculator you still need to know long division but after you know long division it's okay to start using a calculator to make mathematical problems and homework a lot faster and easy but you still know the back end process of it and so make sure that when you're looking at all these fancy schmancy different things you make sure they are languages and you go with the language first because if you enter a job only knowing the framework and not knowing the language behind it that's going to create some real problems for you once you are running into errors and trying to figure out why something's not working meanwhile you never realized what javascript was and here you are programming in react so make sure that you take the time to identify language versus framework if you still are unclear of the difference between the two make sure to before picking something up just google what is x and x so for me i would have said hey what is ruby on rails a language or a framework and they would have said no girl ruby is the language at the end of the day be like nike and just do it truly truly just do it because again there is no loss to be had in that process at the end of the day you're still learning you're still growing you're still developing and so just pick something up and go from there if you're now trying to see how best to go about the learning process i have a video called the best way to learn to code which i hope will help you in that process but if you enjoyed this video please let me know by liking subscribing i make two to three of these a week and so yeah you would see a lot of these just coming at you just trying to help you out trying to give you the best resources insights and so thank you so much for watching and i'll see you all later bye"}
