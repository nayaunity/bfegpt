and i provide content for new and aspiring software engineers and today we're going to be talking about reasons to go to a coding bootcamp in 2021 now this is a follow-up to my previous video of reasons to not go to a coding bootcamp in 2021 where i was brutally honest with things so if you want to check that out check that out and i'll link it above but now to give you the whole picture this is why to go to boot camp in 2021 so let's get to it so reason number one the first reason you should go to coding bootcamp specifically in 2021 is because interest rates are at a record low right now now why am i talking about interest rates well coding boot camps are expensive one of the reasons in my last video why i said you shouldn't go but if you need to take out a loan to cover you know the ten thousand twelve thousand fifteen thousand twenty cause to the boot camp well you're in luck because interest rates are very low and so you'd be able to get a loan for you know not much hassle and that is not very you know expensive and so of course things you know contribute to the rate you'll get such as your own credit score but in general if you have a good credit score and you know is depending on the length of the loan and everything interest rates really won't look too bad for you as opposed to other time periods reason number two you should go to a coding bootcamp now because it is virtual now this depending on who you are this could be good this could be bad for me it was oh so good because i was able to go to a coding boot camp that wasn't in the city that i lived in if everything was in person and all normal it would have been very difficult for me to commit to that lifestyle because it would have required me to get up at 8am drive an hour down to the city the coding bootcamp was in spend the entire day and get back at around 8pm if not later but because things were virtual i was able to do everything from the comfort of my bed and when i say my bed i quite literally mean my bed i was one of the bad students who wouldn't even get up from my bed and go to a separate table or desk or anything i would people when they you know when we were in classes and everything they would see my headboard right behind me different strokes different strokes it's okay but it is so much easier for me or it was so much easier for me to commit to a boot camp because i didn't need to make that journey every single day and so if that's the case for you that's really a reason why boot camp would be great now now some of y'all may be thinking okay well i could choose you know the online version you know instead of the in-person version because the online version of coding bootcamp for most coding bootcamps is self-paced it's often designed for people who um you know have demanding jobs or you know can't go to the city they're in or prefer a more more autonomy over what they do day by day however i wanted an in-person experience because i felt that i'd be more held accountable that way and i liked being able to ask life questions to my instructors and you know really get those live updates which you can't with which for with my understanding i don't know i don't know i never did the online version um but yeah it was less so with the online now this is confusing because we were in a parallelogram so what was online and what was in person they were both i i don't like to say they were both online i say one was an online which was you know the self-paced more type experience and one was virtual in person and so i chose the virtual in person which would have been the regular in person if we weren't in this whole panera bed so just something to think about you know if you're in a city that it would be hard for you to take that daily trip your family situation is a way that it's better for you to stay at home rather than go somewhere and all of that it's virtual right now so you know that could be a very good thing if you let it now the next reason to go to a coding boot camp is because you are the person who prefers an actual learning roadmap when it comes to learning new skills or you know transitioning into a certain life you prefer having an actual roadmap now i'm not saying you prefer to have an actual roadmap and you know teaching is the only way you know you get that but i'm saying if you are this is the reason to go to a coding bootcamp this was my situation i started out learning with codecademy and udemy courses however because i am a person who needs to one be held accountable by some larger figure either a teacher or an administrator or anything like that and because i didn't know what i was doing i didn't know that you know the next step to learning javascript is to learn you know if statements then after you learn if statements you know you try you know you learn try catch then you go to ruby like i didn't know what the sequence should be and so because of that i needed a teacher i needed somebody in authority who created an actual curriculum to guide me some people are able to create their own curriculums through you know codecademy and through udemy and youtube tutorials and there are just so many different resources out there for you to transition to software engineering without spending loads of money there are and please please please before this is an asterisk before you decide to go to coding bootcamp please please please try out those things first so you can really understand why you are going to a boot camp and what you're really hoping to get out of it because again that's so much money y'all that's that's so much money but if you are like me who did these three things and then got stuck because you didn't know what the next step is but you also aren't trying to you know get a whole master's a whole another bachelor's degree and all of that go to going to a coding boot camp may be the right path for you because again it's quick relatively you know quick when we're talking about whole career shifts as quick then yeah that would be a great reason for you to go to a coding boot camp and lastly the reason you should go to a coding boot camp is because depending on the boot camp in my boot camp this was the case you have the opportunity to get all of your money back if you don't get a job after you finish your boot camp i don't know how many boot camps do this i went to flat iron school and that was the case for me and so for me i was like you know what's there to lose either i get a job or i get a refund to me it was very low risk and so that could be a great way for you to become a software engineer through a coding bootcamp because it's 2021 and people are broke up in here people are broke people are struggling and if we can get that assurance that is great that would be great and so again not all boot camps offer um this you know clause if you design if you decide to sign up with them but i personally recommend looking for ones that do because then it just made the decision much easier for me it made me feel like i really wasn't risking much now this is you know like a whole other asterisk look into the things you need to do to ensure that refund so here's the thing so a boot camp says 100 money back if you don't get a job in three months let's say that is what they say when you read the fine print this is the case for me when you read the fine print of that statement you get a whole laundry list of things that you must do between you know finishing coding bootcamp during coding bootcamp and up to three months after um completing your bootcamp you need to be able to have done all of these things and if you haven't done all these things which included contact you know people on linkedin three times a day um write write two blog posts a month um all of these different things if you don't do just one of them there goes a refund there it goes so make sure that the things when you read the fine print of whatever boot camp that is stating these things make sure that they're things that really do seem actually possible and plausible for you for you specifically to do because yeah if you're going on this path because you feel like it's risk-free but then you end up not getting the refund and now you're unemployed for a year and you still don't you know you don't have a job you have this 15 000 in debt and you know you're not getting this refund then that i'd say was not a great choice for you and so make sure you read that fine print and see exactly what they list out you that's the things you need to do in order to get that refund so but the reason they say these things out is because to them they say well you know what if you do all of these things then you will get a job and so you know that's why we list those things out so it's not like a it's not bad but make sure for you specifically it's something that every single thing on that list would be plausible for you so there we have it everybody the reasons you should go to a coding bootcamp in 2021 but please put any questions you have down below and i'll try to answer them either through the comments or through making an actual video and please don't forget to subscribe i'm so happy every time i see somebody subscribe and somebody interacting in this community it makes me very very happy so please subscribe and choose to
