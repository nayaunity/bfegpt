{"video_title": "COMPUTER SCIENCE DEGREE VS. CODING BOOTCAMP VS. SELF TAUGHT IN 2021", "transcript": "hello everybody my name is nyan i'm the black female engineer and i provide content for new and inspiring engineers and today we're going to be talking about the different ways you can get into software engineering by going you know to college and getting a computer science degree versus going to a coding boot camp versus self teaching we're going to be talking about the difference in those three routes and so let's get into it so let's start off with getting a college degree this is something that most people would recognize as like the traditional way to go into software engineering getting a computer science degree however lately within you know the last couple of years there has been some debate as to the best way to go into the field with a college degree there are many many pros to this one especially if you're you know 18 to 22 years old you can get that college experience but specifically when we are talking about learning what you need to know for software engineering it provides you extensive knowledge of you know computer programming and algorithms and things like that you also through going to a college you also get a lot of exposure to companies like google like twitter because of recruitment efforts that they make efforts that the college itself makes and things like that on top of that if you want to work for big companies like google like twitter it should be noted that with college and being able to learn algorithms so extensively it could set you on um a better path to work for a company like that you in my opinion i i don't know in my opinion you have a better chance of getting a job right after college to a place like google rather than getting um a job right away after self-teaching or coding boot camp at a place like google because you would have gotten the extensive knowledge and algorithms which is very very important as google is a search engine and those types of things matter time complexity matters space complexity matters so those are things to think about however when it comes to a specialized knowledge college is not really the place you do that yes you get extensive knowledge in you know computer programming but you also get extensive knowledge in you know whether an atmosphere and in human biology and in you know social you know justice classes and things like that and so it sometimes you know depending on what your goals are sometimes it's not the right path because i'm trying to you know if you're trying to be a front-end engineer and why am i over here taking science and you know dissecting frogs and everything like why am i wasting my time doing that when i should be learning languages and frameworks also in terms of you know front-end engineering college or most colleges most traditional colleges don't teach the modern languages they don't teach you know frameworks like react and bootstrap you tend to learn more um of the like older languages java um c sharp c plus plus things like that and so that's something to note like if you know you're trying to be a you know front-end engineer and do you have a real interest in ux and ui design and you want to be very competitive right away and get what you're paying for college may not be the right place for that what might be the right place for that going into our my next section is a coding bootcamp coding bootcamp provides a very specialized knowledge me i am a coding bootcamp grad i received a college education but i received my degree in finance so to become a software engineer and to you know get through that transition i went through a coding bootcamp specifically a full stack software engineer program and so with that it was very very specialized what we were learning we were learning a back-end technology a back-end framework to match a front-end technology a front-end framework to match put those together we got full stack so that is the route i decided to take so one great benefit is that specialization and because you are so specialized you can get through that process in just a matter of months three to four to six to up to a year rather than college riches four years of learning not but not only computer science but all of these different electives and add-ons and so because with a coding bootcamp you spend you know so much time learning just one thing you get through it faster now coding bootcamp is expensive college is expensive too but when you look at what you are getting out of college versus what you're getting out of a coding bootcamp in terms of just curriculum and experience coding bootcamp is more expensive you know 10 to 20 000 dollars so literally yeah tens of thousands of dollars for three months four months six months a year and so you have to think is it worth it is it worth getting into that debt with college it is you know a lot of money you know up to hundreds of thousands of dollars at the end of the four years but there's robust structures for scholarships and financial aid and you get things that you can't get with the coding boot camp like a one college experience something that may be important to you and two opportunities to learn different things which for some people they want to be dissecting frogs you know when in between coding classes like that's something they want to do that's not something that is a deterrent and so looking at the cost of coding boot camp just in itself for the months you're getting it is so expensive especially because there are very limited ways of um getting through that cost really your only ways for payment are is a loan or cash some offer scholarships i was lucky enough to get um a scholarship but that only covered a pretty small portion of the entire cost and so that is something that you really have to sit down with your accountant and think about and on top of that with coding boot camps or at least most ones i didn't you don't learn algorithms and this is something that is not always needed not always like specifically necessary for you specifically in the type of position you want but it's often very necessary during interviews and so what ended up happening was i had to kind of like take this crash course you know myself in algorithms and things like that and practice constantly after the coding boot camp was over and really learned this to make sure that during interviews when i would be asked these things i looked you know the part i looked like i could be the person for the job and so it is unfortunate that you know sometimes it requires the work outside of the coding bootcamp even though you just paid tens of thousands of dollars for this boot camp but then to be specifically hired not even to do the job like the job can have nothing to do with alcohol algorithms specifically but to just to be hired or to be seen as hireable you need to learn algorithms and so now you pay tens of thousands of dollars for x y and z but you can't even get to this end point without learning this middle point of algorithms and so now you're doing that all on your own and so that is something that is very disappointing but you can also be one of the lucky ones who doesn't get a technical interview portion of their you know interview and the company they're looking for really cares about who you are as a person how teachable and how moldable you are which i wish all companies did i wish all companies did that because you know what i can learn you know all these different if statements and algorithms and you know o of n squared but you can't teach me to be a nice person you can't teach me to be driven and you know prepared and all of these things necessary to be truly successful but there's my you know there's my ted talk for the day but yes in summary for coding boot camps it is a much more specialized route for you to go to it's because of this you know specialization it's much faster to become a software engineer through this route but it's also extremely expensive and you don't get to learn algorithms so now we have self-taught before i talk about you know self-taught i just want to make note that the way i see things if you're a software engineer you're self-taught every software engineer no matter if you went to school for this if you went to a boot camp for this you are self-taught because your college you know you didn't teach your javascript and so now you're in there in your dorm room learning javascript your bootcamp you know didn't teach you this framework and that framework they taught you true frameworks and so now you're over here preparing for this new job you have learning view and now just keep that in mind no matter which route you end up going to there's a level of self-teaching that goes into it but for matters of this video when i say self-teaching i mean you didn't do anything else you didn't go to a boot camp you don't go to any program at all you don't go to school or anything you are in your room studying it up by yourself so with self teaching one of the biggest pros of self teaching is the cost or the lack thereof it is really the cheapest option because you can buy just books of udemy courses for you know ten dollars a pop you know if it's if there's a sale i mean i i come in at the sales but just books of ruby and javascript and react and bootstrap and all these things that are coding bootcamp would teach you a college would teach you and create a curriculum for yourself you can also get to resources like free code camp free code camp has um a fantastic youtube channel where you get hours hours of material in just one video you get to build full applications full features in just one video five hours each that is something that um has become more common you know lately with you know the rise of you know youtube and search engines and things like that people creating material for the general public that is either free or very low cost and so free code camp isn't the only you know people to do this if you just you know google how to you know create a website boom there is a tutorial for you shameless plug but you can really learn a lot from just looking at the resources around you and a lot of them free so that is one of the biggest benefits of self-teaching there's also a great community for people who are looking to go into engineering through self-teaching that is something that i think um people don't really like realize is very can be very crucial to one's success the community that they're in especially with engineering the engineering community specifically like people learning how to be an engineer and learning how to code it is a very amazing community that can really lift you up in your darkest days and get you through that finish line whether or not you know yourself teaching or going through some program it is something that can be very very helpful and so for self-teaching you still have that community with you so if you're looking for you know people to you know hold you up and things like that don't think you need to go to a program to do that you can still have that with self-teaching now where the difficulty in self-teaching comes and this is this was my difficulty and what led me to go to a coding boot camp is now no one's really holding you accountable for your um progress for your learning it's all you and so you need to be the one to remind yourself every single day while you're doing what you're doing and make sure you're taking those five hours six hours eight hours every single day every other day to learn your craft and perfect it that is something that is very hard to do for some people for me it's very hard to do i need to be held accountable by a third party specifically by someone who has authority over me and i need to be held accountable by also something other than just a person like for example money i paid for this like you best believe i'm getting through this you know they said no refunds at the door like i am getting through this and so because of that you know fact that i already opened my wallet to this i know i'm getting through this where self teaching doesn't have that um associated risk i'd say to it where it's like you paid for this or this person is you know telling you you have an assignment due or things like that that's where self teaching can be hard where self teaching can also be hard is you don't really have a road map you don't have a teacher saying this is the best way to you know become a full stack developer starting here then going down to here then going here and then ending here you don't really get that you have to really kind of look at the community and the resources around you and do your research to create that curriculum but it can be done once you find out you know that curriculum then you you know purchase your udemy you know purchase your codecademy courses go on go on free code camp and look at the necessary things but that specifically i'd say is one of the hardest things lastly another you know thing that can be difficult to overcome is having questions you watch this youtube video you know for five hours but you misunderstood something a teacher said or you did not understand why the teacher chose this function versus this function you can't really raise your hand you know you can't really you know go to udemy and i mean you can they have those comments sections but like i don't know i like a teacher saying naya this is why i chose x y and z and giving me a full rundown and me being able to ask follow-ups on top of it instead of me waiting a day two days three days and now my whole learning schedule is out of whack because i never got through that one question i had so that's something that can be difficult but then again that's where the magical gift of google comes in put in that question in google put in that question in youtube just get a different video you know to explain to explain to you why they chose x function versus x so yeah to sum up the self teaching it is extremely cheap the really the cheapest option two you have a great community to you know keep you accountable and keep you motivated however sometimes it takes more than a community to keep you motivated it takes you know actual risk like money to keep you motivated and you don't get the you know one-to-one instruction where a teacher can specifically guide you and you know answer your questions and make sure that are on the right path and so those are you know just you know more things to think about if you are trying to pick between the three right now overall i would think about what your end goal is if you can figure out that end goal then you can have a better understanding of which route to take there we go everybody if i you know help shed some knowledge on anything for you today please hit that subscribe button and i will see y'all soon so bye y'all"}
