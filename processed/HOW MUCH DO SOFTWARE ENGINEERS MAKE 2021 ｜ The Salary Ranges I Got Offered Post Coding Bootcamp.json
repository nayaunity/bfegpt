{"video_title": "HOW MUCH DO SOFTWARE ENGINEERS MAKE 2021 \uff5c The Salary Ranges I Got Offered Post Coding Bootcamp", "transcript": "hello everybody my name is nya and i'm the black female engineer i provide content for new and aspiring software engineers and today we are going to be talking about salaries specifically the three salaries i was offered after my coding bootcamp these are three different jobs all some type of iteration of developer engineer and they were all entry-level roles so keep that in mind however very quick don't forget to add me on instagram and dm me with any question you may have about me software engineering coding boot camp anything at all because i will be filming a q a video where i'll be answering these questions directly and giving you a shout out as well because i just love engaging with you all so yeah go on over there after this video i'll be going through this chronologically so not based on um salary range or lowest to highest or anything like that i'll be going through this based on when i received my offer so let's get to it job number one i received this offer about three hours after my coding bootcamp graduation so i was very grateful very happy that day and this offer was for 68 000 base on top of this there was also a 5 000 starting um bonus as well i wouldn't get it you know until after i had been working there for a couple weeks um i don't remember how much time i would have had to be working there for me to finally get it i think a couple weeks at most so this made the total year one compensation package 73 000 because of that 5 000 bonus but then every year thereafter would be a 68 000 yearly compensation because that is the base now for me i had started this job hunt um with a certain salary minimum in mind this was based on the average salary of entry level you know developer in my location i highly highly recommend using resources like levels.fyi or glassdoor or other you know calculators salary calculators or anything like that i'll link those two down below because those were like what i was you know living on when i was going through job hunts but i recommend using these to just have a better understanding of what you can expect and not expect what you should ask or not ask for well maybe not not ask for i'll never say don't ask for something but yeah what um you should go into this job hunt um presuming expecting etc so i'll link those below but yes for me my minimum um was 75 000 that was based on the location based on entry level position this will change based on if you're looking at mid-level roles if you're looking at senior roles but i was looking at entry level rules and so yeah my mineral was 75 000 and that was for base and so i was a bit disappointed when i got that first um job offer especially because i had kind of just been in the mindset of after if i get you know this job offer i am hanging it up i am done looking for jobs like i i can't because it is so mentally toning all you see is the announcements on linkedin and everything of the new jobs someone got you don't see the 200 applications that they sent to finally get two callbacks or to finally you know the ridiculous amount of negotiation they had to do to finally get paid paid fairly but you know that's a conversation for a different day but but yeah you don't um people don't talk about how mentally tolling it is and it's really mentally tolling and by then i was so over it like i was like lord please like i i can't keep doing this and um so i had been very happy i had gotten the job offer but also disappointed um that the salary was below my minimum so i decided to just you know put my big girl pants on and just keep looking for you know a few more weeks a few one or two months just keep on interviewing keep on connecting and just see what happens the next offer i got didn't happen until about three weeks after this also was for an entry level position and the offer i got was 80 000 base so that was very exciting um yeah it was very very exciting and they also had a bonus they had a twelve thousand dollar bonus um added on to the offer which half would have been paid at signing and then half would have been paid as a starting bonus after working again maybe for a few week days for a few weeks something like that i was very enthused um especially you know when you know that after you sign this then you get cash right then and there so this brought the total year one compensation to 92 000 but then every year after to 80 000 because that was the base i felt in terms of salary i felt very comfortable i felt that it was something that i could definitely sign on and you know just work there and all of that now hold up because about three minutes later i received another job offer and this offer was for ninety thousand dollar base and ten thousand dollar starting bonus and so you can imagine just how enthused i was on the phone for that you know that time period where i just got back-to-back offers that was just a very very exciting moment very much grateful that i was patient very grateful that um i got to that point and so for job number three it brought the total compensation for year one to a hundred thousand dollars and then ninety thousand dollars every year there after because that was the base now funny story on this very quick but history i didn't realize that it was a ninety thousand dollar base until like until more time than i would care to um admit because over the phone i had thought that they had offered me 80 000 base with a 10k uh starting because over the phone um these are all all the offers i got initially were all over the phone and so um for job number three it was no different and over the phone um the person i was speaking to said you were offering you 90 000 um including a 10k signing or 10k starting bonus and so to me i thought that was 80 000 plus 10k to be 90 000 total so you can imagine my surprise when x amount of time goes by and i finally like i get the actual like offer letter and it lists the um benefits and the you know the offer and everything and i see the number 90 and the number 10 on you know a whole different line i was like oh my gosh it's a 90 000 base because um sometimes you don't get the actual letter until a few days or a few weeks after um because that stuff does take time to just take you know certain you know authority figures and just lawyers and like things like that and so sometimes you don't get that till um a little bit after and so yeah imagine my surprise when i open that letter and i see a whole ten thousand more um so you know i'm not going to say which job i took but but no no for real though no matter and this is like y'all might roll your eyes at this each of the jobs if they had given me the same exact offer i still would have gotten gone with the job i chose even if to be honest even if the job i chose offered a little bit less than the others i still would have gone with this job because when i looked at values when i looked at the type of environment that they had the type of vibe they set in the office their initiatives and what they hope to see in the future it just meshed so well with me on a personal and professional level all of these companies were three very different companies um both in terms of the industry they worked in their business model and um their like what's the word i don't want to say vibe um what's the word like their values i feel like there's another word i don't know i don't know but yeah in terms of their vibe not just values in terms of their vibe they were three very very different companies and so something to think about is of course of course salary is important i'm not saying so like i was a finance major like money is important like i'm not saying don't think about it but along with that think about how a company makes you feel now i know like some people are gonna like roll their eyes when they hear this but if you are interviewing with a company if you're interacting with them going through the application process and they constantly just maybe don't bring off the best vibes maybe they you know make you feel a certain way in certain situations and certain you know interview questions or things like that remember that like lean into that and really think about it because an interview and like the application process is when the company should like be its best you know what i mean because they're trying to bring people in and so if during that process you don't feel great then imagine how it's going to be once you start working there i'm not saying that if they made you feel great during the interview you're going to feel great doing the job like there are tons of times where then companies flip up on you and then it's like this is not the same company i interviewed for x amount of months ago um so i'm not saying that but if they can't even be you know amazing and be very um kind and thoughtful during your the application and interviewing and recruitment process that is in my experience not a good sign for what awaits you at the other end of that offer if you decide to join the company all of that so really go into this writing down a list of things that are most important to you with um this job that you know you hope to have and see where salaries tax up on that is that number one is it number two is three is it the last thing on the list while you know assist education assistance is the first thing or um vacation is is the second thing like look at the different um things that you would accept or deny an offer for and really just rank them and when you start getting your offers and you will start getting your offer i believe in manifestation you will get there really just um bring out that list again because it's fun and dandy when you see the number at first but then when you take a look at all the other parts the job would encompass and the people you'd be working with and things like that that's when it can either make you want the job more or actually say you know what this salary isn't worth it but yeah i think all y'all can guess which job i chose but it's not because of the salary it's really not it's because of how they made me feel and um just me being very excited to work for them so no if you liked
