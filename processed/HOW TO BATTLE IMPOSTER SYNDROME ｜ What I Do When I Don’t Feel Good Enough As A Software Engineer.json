engineer i provide content for new and aspiring software engineers and today we are talking about imposter syndrome now imposter syndrome to me would be defined as feeling like you don't belong where you are you are imposter sometimes i can feel like oh like you got the job that is so exciting and then the next three seconds you think oh my gosh what am i going to do when they find out i'm not skilled enough or i'm not good enough feeling like you fooled you know them the quan quote them your family your friends your company all of that feeling like you do not belong but let me tell you here yeah you do yeah you do and this is how to really really tackle imposter syndrome so that you have to just deal with it less and less and less until you no longer feel this way very first thing when you feel yourself spiraling down that imposter syndrome feeling is to understand what has happened to make you start feeling this way so there are many different things that might happen and there are many ways to go about this so let's start with another person externally someone says something to you to start feeling this way first of all remember that what a person says about you is more of a reflection on them than it is on you people can't do things or couldn't have imagined doing something and so they tried to put you down for accomplishing the very thing that they couldn't the negative things they say to you are a reflection of their own insecurities to them it doesn't matter who they say it to if you weren't sitting at that desk sitting in that chair on the zoo meeting they would have found somebody else to spill this nonsense too so it is not on you not not a reflection it is completely on them and so you need to remember that and squash that real quick if it's not another person it could be yourself i know this is something that i've been battling with very recently me feeling insecure feeling that i am not good enough to be in this field i'm not good enough to be in this company because the people around me the people i'm working with the people on this zoo meeting look nothing like me and that is something that is seriously seriously a real thing because when you see all these people flourishing and getting through their projects with no problem and no bugs or anything and then you are having troubles or in this case for me many people know that i've been going through training for my new job i work as a commerce cloud developer and i just started last month and i've been going through training and so that's been a lot of something i've need to tackle for myself where i look at the people around me and they don't look like me and so i'm going to getting into problems and i say to myself oh i'm not good enough i don't belong here x y and z because i see no one else who looks like me that people tend to not understand how important having people that look like you is because when i mess up it becomes a thing of nigh is the problem and you know nai is not smart enough in my mind that that's what ends up happening but when john messes up it's oh the instructions weren't clear or oh the project is just difficult give them some time and and i'm not saying the company does this but just me looking around like no one says oh john is stupid oh chad doesn't belong here no they don't say that so i need to stop doing that to myself and allow myself the same patience and courtesy i'm giving to everybody else saying nay the code base you're working with is difficult the instructions are vague you will get through it you got this it's fine you'll tackle it as you will and really separating it from i'm not good enough to man these instructions are not good enough so really work on separating that think about what the flip side is if you are in coding bootcamp if you are self-teaching in computer science in your classes or have just started a new job like me and you are running into tech problems into these glitches constantly stop making it about you that sounds so harsh but stop making it about you it's not about you no no no but no do you see what i mean stop thinking about you make it about what you're working on this thing is difficult this thing is hard this thing is you know not well updated and let me work with what i've got it's going to be harder because it's structured this way but let me work with what i got and acknowledge that the things you're working on are hard and the fact that you are struggling means that you are about to learn so so much and that's exactly the third reason that you may be going through this the first was another person saying something second was you yourself observing your you know surroundings and putting that insecurity on yourself and third is your work your the technology you're working with is it that you can't fix a bug is that what created this feeling that there's a bug that is just flashing at you for the last six hours and you can't fix it okay get up get up close your computer and take a break when you take a break when people say take a break when you're having troubles with bugs and things like that it's not because they're saying oh just breathe just chill and you'll get to it and it'll be fine no that's not why they're saying that they are saying it because when you take a break when you stand up get blood flow going move get something to eat watch a show 30 minutes watch some friends watch some fresh prince of bel air sit down then come back to your computer 20 minutes 30 minutes an hour after you are now forced to remind yourself of where you were you are now forced to open up your files again you have to look through what instructions you're going through or what tutorial you're going through and what line of code you are on and remind yourself what even the point of that code is it's in that reminding yourself and getting reacquainted in yourself that the magic happens because now that you've been forced to take a couple steps back you now will find the bug you now will understand what the problem is either one because you and previously had lost sight of the bigger picture the why behind your code you now came back and we're like oh why am i working that's what am i working on and then it clicked you're trying to do x y and z and so you know exactly how to make it work that or number two it's with the taking a few steps back that the bug lied in it wasn't in the thing that you currently were looking at it was in the four steps before that you had done previous hours ago that created this bug now and you didn't know it until now because it just wasn't relevant and so now that you had taken a break and had to start from four steps back all over again to remind yourself of where you were you saw that bug and now you're like oh there it is that is why it's important to take a break i if someone had just said this i would have started taking breaks a long time ago then when it works you're no longer an imposter you know you made it work you're so happy so excited and you're now feeling like the bad mother shut your mouth that you really are the fourth reason you might be you know feeling that impostor syndrome is because you can't find work you've done the teaching the instruction the training and you can't find work now if that's the case yes i see how that can be extremely disappointing and i will allow you the three minutes to cry about it but after those three minutes you please please please see all the different ways you are present on a professional level your resume your linkedin your github all of that and see what things you can revamp and there's always something you can revamp revamp your resume to do x y and z revamp your linkedin make sure you're posting a lot more make sure you're networking make sure you're playing that game it's a lot better to feel like you're doing something than it is to just i don't know i've i've always felt better doing things i've always also felt more motivated and excited about like life then i have just accepting defeat um i hope that makes sense again stop turning things inwards and saying i'm not good enough and really reflected on everything else in terms of okay i'm in a rough economy right now let me be patient let me play that networking game let me make sure i am being present and people know i'm looking so that i can have my best odds of getting the position i want rather than being saying oh i'm stupid i'm not good enough i hate that word even saying it i think you guys saw i hesitated i hate that word i hate that but anyway i do not ever call yourselves stupid or dumb like it makes me so emotional even saying it don't ever call yourself that because if call yourself that you your body your mind your actions will start believing it start reflecting it and that is no way to be not only in work but in life seriously there are so many people in this world whose main purpose in life seems to be to just drag you down and so you need to be the one person who's on your corner if there is nobody else around and just be like no you can say whatever you want with your computer science degree with your you know google internship with your xyz say whatever you want i'm gonna be over here working on myself working on these projects and i'll see you at the top if you even make it there and i really wanted to post this video today because it was very relevant for today i had been working i had been you know just minding my own business eating my do you guys know that video like eating my mcdonald's or something and um i go on instagram and i see this thread of comments from a person who was very much his goal for that day i think was to find people he can put down or try to put he had seen my account and everything and just started saying these belittling comments saying things like oh i gave my grandmother a macbook and she turned it on i guess now she's a software engineer too or things like that i think he's deleted that comment but there's more if you can like i'm not gonna say which post it is but you'll be able to find it just fine but if you look for it but um yeah it was this that made me for a second just like feel like that like like an imposter like am i really good enough x y and z and i very quickly had to remind myself of who i am my credentials pull up my own little resume and remind myself that i taught myself to code and was able to secure a job at a fortune 20 company and am now right now working as a commerce cloud developer and am contributing everywhere i can and learning everywhere i can and just continuing that process of bettering myself professionally in my learning and just i keep looking over here because that's where my computer is so i think i'm also talking to my i don't know but um i had to experience that for myself doing those steps of remembering who i am and acknowledging why i'm feeling like this x y and z and so there will be so many people y'all especially if you're coming at this from a non-traditional route or if you're a person of color or a woman in this field there will be people who try to put you down for it say you don't belong say you took the easy route meanwhile they don't realize that you spent 60 hours a week up till 3am crying trying to figure out why certain processes won't work making sure you're sending your resume to everybody and their mama just working so hard to make sure you make this life for yourself and some people just refuse to see those things and instead when seeing you they see all the things that they couldn't do and they decide to put you down for that and so i really wanted to make this video for y'all but also for myself and i'm really excited for the next few weeks getting to interact with you more both on social media and here i plan to make more tutorial videos don't worry i know y'all on it don't worry i've been working a lot i work about 70 hours a week because two of my contracts overlap each other but in two weeks that will be done and so i'll be giving you so much more of that so please be patient with me and i'm looking forward to creating some day in the life videos for you all getting to talk about really what i do on a day-to-day and really just yeah try to give you all some insight into what you may expect in this type of role so i really hope you enjoyed this i you remember some of these things i hope i remember some of these things but youtube tells me that about 70 of are enjoying my content but don't subscribe so please click that subscribe button i love seeing this community grow and i'll see y'all later bye y'all"}
