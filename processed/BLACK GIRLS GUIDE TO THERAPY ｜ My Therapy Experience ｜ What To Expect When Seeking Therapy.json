i provide content for new and inspiring software engineers and today i want to just talk a little bit more about my therapy journey it's something i have mentioned in the past and past videos that i've been going to therapy for a couple of months now and yeah i just wanted to sit down and talk to you all about how i got here how i chose my therapist and if you're looking into therapy just what you may expect in the process so yeah let's get to it so i've been wanting to get a therapist for a long time like since i was a kid i remember asking my mom like mom can i have a therapist can i go see a therapist because i just knew that there were some things that i wanted to actually talk through with a professional i have typically for a long time maybe not always but for a very long time had some anxiety problems or issues or just you know my life has just been harder because of my anxiety levels at times and so as a kid i knew that like yo this is not this is not it and so i remember asking way back when 4-1 but i ended up not getting one and come college i thought about it a lot more especially with college where there's so much change happening all at once all of a sudden you're in this whole new location your family is nowhere to be found you have all these new friends forming it's just so much that i knew specifically in college like you i need i need somebody to sit down with but because i you know i'm a college student so i'm still on my parents insurance at the time i was like i don't want to talk about i don't want them to know i don't want them to know that i'm going to a therapist so i come from a zimbabwean background i was born in zimbabwe and so there tends to be that thought of oh they're they're going to see a therapist the okay what's cuckoo like it tends to be that um yeah type of sentiment around the idea of therapy and so i just didn't want to bring my parents into it and i also didn't just in general want them to ever ask me about therapy how it's going or i would just i know it's terrible i know it's terrible i just wanted it to just be a me thing all to myself and that was that and so throughout college even though i really really constantly thought about it i decided to wait and was like you know what i'll wait until i have a job that way i can pay for it myself and i you know will be on the jobs insurance will be off my parents and they just will never know now fast forward to fall of last year so fall of 2020 i started having a bit more income and more flexibility with my income i got my own apartment i was really just setting up the building blocks of my life and i have a friend of mine who sees a therapist and she's very open with it i asked her how it was going and she had just switched to a therapist who happened to be a black woman and so when she said this i was like oh word i was like oh wow okay can i get her information do you mind if i get her information and you know how is she you know first how is she how do have you liked your sessions um and yeah do you mind if i get her contact and all in all she's like no it's been good so far she enjoyed the experience and so i ended up contacting that therapist that either that day or you know just a few days after now and this is what was very rough was because i would have been you know considered you know a new patient it took a very long time for me to actually get to see her in person so my thing with therapy and i think many people can share the same feelings i do is for me one of the hardest parts is finding somebody not in terms of the search itself but the trial and error of it of okay so i'm going to have this one session and we'll see if it's a match and if it's not then i have another session that's the exact same you know of me spilling my guts out all over again seeing if they're good fit if it's not then i do another and it's just this it's honestly just not a fun process because you feel like you're going nowhere you've done five sessions and you're in the exact same place as you were a month ago because it's the same thing over and over again because it's a new person it's like dating you know like it's a new person they know nothing about you they need to hear your story over and over again and so that can be just very emotionally tolling and so i really did not want to do that so when my friend said she had you know been seeing this black female therapist i was like bet say no more and i really just hopped on that now i mentioned it took about yeah about six weeks for me to see her for the first time that's really because and i didn't know this um and i maybe not every therapist is the same in this regard but from my understanding what will happen is you know therapists or mental health you know specialist providers counselors etc they have certain a certain schedule based around their quote unquote regulars then they decide how often to take in new people and so if a counselor therapist specialist has let's say a full eight-hour schedule built out and they really don't want to take a new people it could be a very very long time before you get to actually see them for the first time then when you finally get that first appointment with your therapist and you see that you would like to be a part of their regular rotation that's when you can see them kind of anywhere anytime you want every day and wait wait not every maybe but every week every other week twice a week etc it's a lot easier to build those types of schedules and so that's why it took such a long time for me to have just that first appointment with my therapist okay so something about me is i do not like being new at something and it's not that i don't like learning new things or trying new things out i don't like being a beginner in the sense that i have to train for this thing for example training weeks oh my gosh training for a job being their first orientation or training week i cannot stand it because i just want to get to the work you know what i mean i remember when i was learning how to play guitar i hated just the me being bad at it because it means if i like a song i can't just go straight in and learn it right away i have to get through all these other nooks and crannies to even get to that point same thing with therapy there's about one to three weeks where you're not even getting into the really main biscuits and gravy of why you're here and everything you want to talk about and your childhood traumas and things like that you're kind of just getting to know one another or they're trying to just know about you my first session with my therapist they had a questionnaire that they went through and we talked through the different topics in that question so for example one of the questionnaire questions could be i suffer from abandonment yes no sometimes and then the next question can be i have a good relationship with my parents yes no sometimes so and of course there's a lot heavier questions that will be in that questionnaire i just didn't want to bring those up here but yes it's really more about setting the stage laying that foundation so that they also know as a professional really what they would like to tackle first to make sure that you're okay to make sure that you're safe and so that was the first one two three for me personally it was the first two sessions where it was just going through these this questionnaire and so i didn't like that at all i understand it's necessary please believe me i understand it's necessary i just didn't like it because for me to be here you know there's things i need to talk about so badly with you and so i remember making like a mental note of you know what the next time i let's say switch therapists or go through this situation again i want to book like three three sessions in just one week that way we can just get it all over with and i'm not a month in for the first time me telling you about my problems and yeah it's been a month and so i made that mental note saying you know what next time if i can i'm going to just jam-pack all of this prerequisite um questioning as much as i can so that we get to the real mix of everything as soon as possible so i mentioned that for the longest time i didn't want to tell my parents that i was seeking the help of mental health professionals and for the first couple of sessions about three sessions i paid them all out of pocket which for me it was almost two hundred dollars per session and i after the third session i was like nah this is not i was a finance major naya this is not the financially responsible thing to do even if you make a million dollars if you can avoid spending something by just saying i have insurance and saying here's my insurance card or just anything do it you know and so i after that third session i was like nah this is not a responsible way to go like you're trying to build your savings you're trying to do x y and z don't keep doing this i was willing to budget that money out for this but i was like why you and you have insurance you have the ability to not be paying this much and so i sat down i was like okay let's let me talk to my mother and tell her that i'm seeking you know mental health assistance and i am going to be doing this for the you know next i don't know 100 years of my life and if you see a charge to the insurance his eye and that is why so yeah i called my mom up and i made it very i was very matter-of-fact with it because i didn't want any questions i didn't want any questions i didn't want any comments even i was like oh yeah and by the way i started seeing a therapist so if you see a charge um that's that's me so how was your sunday i i left no room and so since then since then that was really it to be honest and i'm glad i did that for you know i'm talking about mental health but i also care about financial well-being as well and so i am glad i did that for that um but i i'm i'm disappointed that it took even three sessions for me to be like nah this is your mental health if you had just sprained your ankle you wouldn't be oh i don't want it to show but yeah told my mom hung up the phone and now i pay 30 dollars per session and it's different depending on your insurance that's my um like the co-pay is 30 some people could be 50. it could be 60. it could be none it could also be none and it also can depend on how often you go and so for me i go once per week i've been going for about six months now and i asked i actually called the insurance and asked them let's say hypothetically i wanted to go every single day of the week would it still stay at 30 or is it a 30 co-pay as long as you don't exceed let's say six sessions a month and so that can also be different depending on your insurance and so if you don't know or if you think you would want more frequent visits then i highly recommend um just calling and asking calling and asking my insurance actually didn't take long i've had longer calls with credit card companies over you know stupid charges on my cards than i did with the with the insurance people asking them about the therapy sessions so don't think it has to be this crazy half day gone thing it was a pretty quick um call maybe like five to ten minutes so yeah i've been going for about six months now um let's see december yeah i've been going for about six months now and i personally think it has start i think is just now starting to help for the first maybe three months i don't think i saw much of a difference in me or in my mental well-being and i i know that's really odd to say um but i'm just now starting to see the everyday impact it has where let's say i'm going i'm getting stressed out and then i remember something you know my therapist said or i'm planning out my future and i am less anxious about it because i know that this is the mentality i'm having now rather than what it has been in the past and so it had it did take a long time because even after your first one to three intro sessions you're still learning a lot about each other you're still getting your groove together and it takes time to get to that level of comfort of sitting down and now me i sit down like girl you won't believe so it's like things like that i don't say that but i'm just saying it's now i'm now in a place where i'm much more comfortable with them where i can just be like yo you won't believe the things i just happened one thing i also had to be patient about is not letting my expectations of what therapy would be like or what i would get from my therapist overshadow the experience itself and so what i mean by that is there would be times where i share something and i'm an overthinker and so i would share something and i'd be annoyed if the if they didn't respond with oh well why didn't why do you feel that way or no how about we go into deeper or what do you think and they wouldn't ask those typical therapistic questions because that was just what i imagined you know and so i would get kind of annoyed of like oh okay she's not she's not gonna ask um okay let me just tell her or things like that but especially again for the first few months you're still trying to get a groove together a lot of times they may just want to just listen to you and see how you tell stories how you recount events how you speak about yourself and others and really just taking that in because they need to know the best way to guide you you know not everything works for everybody like yelling at one person may work but yelling at me no no so keep that in mind if you are like me who has been thinking about it for a while and maybe an overthinker if your expectation for the sessions don't match what it is actually don't pay too much don't put too much thought into that especially if you're new if you're new they really may just be trying to get to know you and understand how best to guide you because now that it's six months in now i'll kind of be stopped in my tracks a little bit like oh okay get with the hard questions i see you okay so so keep that in mind as well yeah i think i'm gonna stop it there before i start rambling and start saying you know things off the wall and whatnot if you're not subscribed please subscribe it helps me out a lot like and comment if you liked it and no i will see you all later bye"}
