that answer is hello everybody my name is Nyan I'm the black female engineer I provide content for new inspiring software engineers and today we're going to talk about coding boot camps is now a good time to go and here let me make sure I make this clear right now when I am talking about coding boot camps in this sense I'm talking about paid coding bootcamps boot camps that cost over ten thousand dollars to attend oh so first things first we cannot have this conversation without having the tech conversation in general I'm pretty sure most of us have seen what's been going on in the world of tech the layoffs and just the decrease in stock prices as well now I'm not saying this to say that right now is not a good time to become a software engineer that's not what I'm saying at all however when we're looking at these Trends specifically the decrease in stock prices that affects the lucrative nature of the offer you are likely to get when you do get a job or an offer as a software engineer in 2022 the tech stock prices decreased by 30 percent now this may not mean much to many people I I feel like it should especially if you're looking to enter the space because what is the number one thing most people brag about when they're talking about their tech jobs money money that's what people tout around that's what they talk about when talking about what made them get into the field and why they love the field so much now something that's not always uh shared explicitly is where that money is coming from many people if they work at Google they work at Netflix Microsoft they will brag about how much money they are being paid and not not I'm not saying that the bragging is wrong but what I am saying is a lot of the money that they're receiving in terms of in regards to compensation comes from this thing called stock options when 30 20 40 of your compensation package is based off of stock options and now you see that stocks have decreased by 30 percent now the value of those options have decreased significantly as well making the compensation package of a faint job or Tech job in general just less lucrative and just less desirable than what it was in the past 2020 pre-2020 Etc now and I mentioned this in the beginning I'm not saying this to say that now is a bad time to become a software engineer but why am I saying it because coding boot camps expect you to put up an investment of 10 12 15 20 000 for a couple of months of learning with this uh almost promise that they give you of hey but you're gonna get a really lavish Tech job you're gonna get a job that pays so much more than this uh than this fee you just need to invest in yourself and yes I am all about investing in yourself but not when that return on investment is different now than it was a couple of years ago and it very much is now that's just one thing now let's talk about another thing chat gbt is so amazing in that it has the potential to help you go towards your goals in a way that's just not been seen before if you saw my last video I talk about how to become a software engineer in four months in lightning speed using chat GPT chat gbt has allowed for extra guidance to be received where before that guidance was maybe only available behind a pay wall I personally have said many times that I believe the main reason a person should make the decision to pay a large sum of money for a coding boot camp is because they want true guidance from somebody who has um who has experience in the field that is why I went I had tried to go the self-teaching route back in 2020 and it just wasn't working for me because I constantly did not know what the next step to take was and it really just hindered my learning and that's what made me find say fine I'll go to a coding bootcamp now however that's not necessarily the case if I want guidance I kind of have it check out that video so you can really see exactly what I mean but where before I would learn something and I didn't know if I was at a good place to learn something else or what that next thing to learn even was now chat gbt is able to spit out the information for you in this so easy to grasp and comprehend manner that I don't really need uh to pay ten thousand dollars to have somebody else tell me how to do it now some of y'all might be asking hey now but according boot camps they might look better on my resume or they'll help me get a job or all these other reasons to go to a coding bootcamp the thing is and I hate say this I'm not trying to call people a liar I'm not coding boot camps don't really help you get the job if you ask most people if you ask me I still very much had to do that all on my own they do Express that they help through advisors through counselors they have connections with jobs to help you get interviews and whatnot and that just wasn't what I saw in my experience I'm going to the job hunt process after spending 16 weeks learning to code did not ever feel oh thank God I went with the coding boot camp because now I have all these different job opportunities no so what I'm saying is if you're going to be doing all that work anyway and now you have a way to receive guidance that doesn't include a coding bootcamp why not go The non-coding Bootcamp route now chatgpt is a humongous resource that all of us I can say have found some type of benefit from away from chai gbt so many more resources have come up in the last couple of years since I have started learning to code even though that was just two and a half three years ago oh my goodness that was three years ago not even a half that was three years ago but yeah so many more resources have come up where if I want to go to a free coding boot camp there are options for me there's Ada Academy there's resilient coders there's a hundred devs and all these other resources that I'm going to link below in the description box but there's just so many more resources now that it's not you're all on your own or you must spend ten to twenty thousand dollars on a boot camp there are Now options in the middle and those options are really good ones some of them so do not skip past looking through those options if you'd like me to do a video on what those options look like please let me know in the comment box below but I see that to say there's just so many more resources y'all and another consideration I would really appreciate you all making is the added cost of the boot camp so coding boot camps cost ten thousand dollars fifteen thousand dollars twenty thousand dollars many people don't just have that to just give many people are taking out loans to do that with interest rates being as high as they are right now coding boot camps if you pay for it via a loan it's not just ten thousand dollars it's not just fifteen thousand dollars it's substantially more than that now because of the high interest you're paying on top of the loan itself and to go back to my first point to do all of that and on top of it the return not be as lucrative as it was before with what compensation packages looks like now it's just another layer to consider when trying to decide whether or not to go to a paid coding Boot Camp or not and so it's now a good time to go to a coding boot camp for me that answer is no I'm not saying it's never a good time I'm not saying different circumstances does not uh decide whether or not it's a good time or not but given what I've talked about here and the resources that have come up in the last few years on top of the financial weight of the decision now as opposed to a couple of years ago I would say it is not a good time to just jump into a coding boot camp I'm not saying don't do it especially if you've tried applying to the free options and you just haven't gotten much luck there and now it's okay I've gone through all the options and this is the only one for me because of the type of learner I am and the situation I'm in then please do not see this as me saying don't do it especially when the options are go to a coding boot camp and get a job or you stay at a place in your life that you don't want to be in and you've tried all these different things it's been months you've been trying to self-teach and do all this it's just not working know that that is not what I'm saying at all so I hope this was helpful I hope it was informative what questions do you have let me know in the comment box below but yeah thank you so much for joining me for another video and I will talk to you all very soon bye all"}
