{"video_title": "THE THINGS I LEARNED FROM CODING BOOTCAMP \uff5c What Attending Coding Bootcamp Taught Me", "transcript": "hello everybody my name is nyan i'm the black female engineer and provides content for you and aspiring software engineers and today we are talking about all the things coding bootcamp taught me speaking of coding bootcamps i would like to thank flatiron school for sponsoring this video i actually went to flat iron school two years ago a year and a half ago and i am i'm in love with everything that came out of it but we'll get more into that a little later so first yeah there's a lot that going to a coding bootcamp will teach you and so let's get into it number one and it's so funny because when i when people said this to me i very much rolled my eyes i was like okay but number one is and this is truly like the biggest one coding bootcamp taught me how to learn and i know how this sounds i know you can stop rolling your eyes at this but it's insane when you think about i think it's because i'm on this side of it now where i am an employed developer and i get it now but you are constantly learning on the job and especially when you are learning a whole new language i learned four different languages frameworks while at flatiron school and that was in 15 weeks and so when you think about that you learn how to learn quickly you learn how to pick up different languages and different functions and scripts and frameworks rapidly quick because you had to do that during coding boot camp and now you're in a new job and it is probably like your biggest skill for my job i needed to know python guess how long it took me to learn python pause the video put it in the comments i'm serious like let's let this be a discussion a fun little game put it in the comments below pause okay it took me a solid 30 minutes now because i knew these other languages when i was faced with a coding problem or coding task i knew exactly how i would solve it but i just didn't know the specific syntax but i knew oh i want to put an if statement here and i want to then put a for loop here um and whatnot and so all i needed to do was look up how to create an if statement in python then boom there was how to create a for loop in python and then boom there it was going to occurring bootcamp just teaches you how to learn like no other so that is something i am extremely extremely grateful for so that's one number two going to a coding bootcamp taught me how to approach a problem so that i can solve it as efficiently and quickly as possible when i say a problem i mean quite literally like a coding task so let's say you're creating an app where users want to add things to their shopping carts and so now you need to figure out how to create functions so that when they click on add to cart the item that they're looking at gets added to their cart and you know stays there and they can re-access it later and whatnot going to recording bootcamp taught me how exactly to approach the problem and so let me give you an example this sounds like a huge undertaking like oh my goodness how am i going to add something to a cart and then i let it stay there and it's like it sounds like a whole thing so i would get now when i'm working everything my whiteboards are my where are they like i've i've moved um if you haven't if you haven't been able to tell i moved everything's everywhere so i can't show you my whiteboard if you've seen other videos you know i have multiple so pre-boot camp i would just see that as just such a big problem but then post boot camp is like okay how can we separate this into the smallest chunks possible so that this big chunk is now itty-bitty chunks and so i would say okay so first the user needs to click something that says add to cart and so first you need to create a either a button or a text that says add to cart so that's number one second the program needs to be able to see okay so when they click on me do something and so that means i need to create an on click function so yeah on click do something now three on click i want the item to be added to their cart so i need to create a database of their cart so that every time they click it grabs that item and puts it into the database four and so you end up being able to just see things in just such a different light where something that seemed so huge and enormous before now is so possible through these little chunks like i just integrated some authentication for the company i'm working for dreamworks for a web app i've been working on and oh my goodness i've never done anything like that before but i was able to see it in a new light because of the skills um that yeah coding bootcamp provided me so that's number number three this is something that so many people i think i just have the wrong idea about coding is not a solo sport at all at all now before you get at me like okay well my cousin timothy over here does all the coding by himself he's a solo programmer he's the only programmer on his entire team in the entire company and so what do you talk about he he does it solo it is a solo sport um actually if you ask timothy um to pull up his search history you will see likely lots and lots of searches for the coding and the functions and the problems he is trying to solve because there's such an amazing community of developers just out there in the world that so many problems that you run into as a coder somebody has the solution you are not likely you are not the first person to run into this problem somebody out there has the solution and so it is still a team sport even if the team isn't right there with you even if you're not talking speaking with the team one on one it is still very much a team support when i attended and enrolled in flattering school i was so overwhelmed in a good way of the community i was immediately part of let me set this thing for you just women and men from all different backgrounds both professionally and personally and demographically looking to do an amazing thing become a software engineer in a solid 15 weeks now if that doesn't get y'all close i don't know what will because oh my goodness the respect we had for one another for one taking this huge step for being brave enough to pursue something like this and also for just being in the thick of it and we just wanted nothing but the best for one another and so that's really where it seeped in like wow yeah no coding the what the movies say with the one person with the ten screens just coding along and he is just in his own bubble and doesn't talk to anybody and he is just like this introvert and whatnot it is usually not true at all flyer school provided me this community of future software engineers looking to do nothing but succeed in their career transition and i'm so so grateful for that along with that in general even though that's a big chunk of um what i credit my success to you're provided so much guidance and just what's the word like i have this like visual of like someone just like leading someone like down a path and you just like going through it of course you know it's not as magical and beautiful when you're in it because it is a lot you're trying to do like i said a huge thing in a short amount of time but the amount of guidance they give you the amount of instruction the amount of attention they give you is truly insane and so if you have been thinking about attending a coding bootcamp flatiron school may be the one for you as a student it was very clear to me that their number one goal was to get me hired get me hired because that's that's the whole point of them and i very much felt that from the very first day of lessons to all the way in my job hunt it definitely is a time and monetary investment but oh my goodness like take it from me y'all i had 50 in my bank account before i enrolled in flatter school i've actually mentioned this in other videos i'm being truly so serious with you and then 15 weeks after i enrolled i received my very first job offer and then by the end of that month of october which is when i graduated by the end of that month here i was signing my six figure job offer and so it is just so crazy how quickly you can go from one situation to the next and now is a great time to do that we've all been given this new start i've been feeling great i've been if you follow me on instagram you know the like energy i've been on lately i've been feeling so amazing because i just feel that 2022 is just the year where we are going to grow we are going to level up we are going to pursue everything that we have set on to pursue and we are going to do the thing you know we're gonna we're gonna go and so check out the link in my description box below to apply if you're not ready to apply it and you want to still see what type of career paths you can go through flatter school is actually offering free lessons in their different courses because they don't just have software engineering they have software engineering yes you can go on the path to become a data scientist you can go the cyber security route or the product design route so there's a different path for the different interests you have and so if you don't know what that is yet or you kind of know but you want to test the waters check out the free lessons the link is in my description box so definitely definitely check that out and see what all 20 20 can do for you and the very last thing that chloe's coding bootcamp taught me is cody is much more creative than you think i've heard people talk about oh you must have this analytical mind and this like oh my goodness like math math and all of this i'm not gonna say they're wrong i'm not gonna i'm not gonna say that i'm just saying there's so much beauty and creativity in code that more people need to talk about because you it's so weird to think about because i know i'm talking about you know a computer and software you know how with painting you can kind of just go freehand and you kind of have an idea of how you want it to go but not really and so you're just like letting you know the brush and everything lead you and you're just like in that moment honestly honestly a lot of times that's how coding for me that's what it feels like it's like okay so i know what i want the end result to be but i don't know how exactly to get there and so i'm just going to keep trying a bunch of things out and just find the beauty and all the different solutions um possible because there are so many different solutions possible in just a regular one assignment or code or problem and that process is just such a beautiful process especially and this will sound weird but especially when things don't work out and you're now challenged to find a different approach it's there that the magic happens where you thought you had it down and now you see it just not gonna work out and so you must find some other way to get put everything together to get that final product and then it works oh my goodness you feel like an artist you feel you feel so great um as you can see i really love my job y'all i i really do um so yeah there's just so much that this journey can teach you and i'm just so excited for you to see all these things for yourself and have your own takeaways and so check out flatiron school again the link is in my description box below yeah let's make 2022 be the year where we're just so in love with our lives and our careers and just every aspect of our lives planner school can definitely help you do that so yeah thanks y'all i'll talk to you later bye"}
