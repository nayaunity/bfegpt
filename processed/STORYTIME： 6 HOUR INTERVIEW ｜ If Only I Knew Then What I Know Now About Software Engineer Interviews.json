engineer i provide content for new and inspiring software engineers and today is going to be much more relaxed more of a conversation i'm going to share with you my experience with a six hour interview day a super day they call it and i thought that this was you know just right timing and everything because you know what today is super bowl day and i'm talking about my own super day so i was like you know what let's chill let's just like have some fun today and let me just share a story with you all so let's get to it so this happened this last fall it was the end of october of 2020 i had just finished my coding boot camp at flatiron school finished that the first week of october and i had been interviewing with this company that is my dream company dream dream company and i assure you all of you know it or if you don't know it you interact with it without knowing it and so one day i see an email pop-up saying that i got to the third and final round of interviews and so i was just you know so ecstatic so excited until you know i read i read a little bit more down i was scrolling scrolling up and i saw the time commitment it said 11 a.m to 5 p.m eastern time [Music] so you know you can imagine my own you know shock and you know stress levels when i saw that this is actually something i've been through in the past this is called a super day a super day interview where you have you know anywhere from four to eight hours of interviewing i've been through about three other ones in the past back when i was a college student i remember going on location to a company to interview from literally nine a.m to six pm and i ended up not getting the job but you know i'm not bitter but yes this is something some companies do this is to allow for different departments to you know get to learn about the candidate um get you at the candidate different things and for everyone at the end of the day to come together and see what they thought about this person and decide if they should give them an offer so it's not something i you know was estranged to or you know didn't know about but still y'all y'all sorry i'm moving my foot it's falling asleep y'all six hours is a long time so the day before the super day i was um and other candidates were given a hackerrank problem to do hackerrank if you don't know is basically a portal or resource that one people can use to brush up their coding skills and you know better their algorithm skill sets and things like that learning you know coding problems but it's also something companies use to basically filter out candidate pools by sending them coding problems and so hacker extends your problem they say you need to solve this between this time and this time and you have x amount of to solve it and everything is administered typically through the company like they set the expiry date they set the time limit and everything hacker rank more just administers it and so we get sent a hackering for the day before our um super day and y'all so this hackering i ran out of time before i could even finish it i was given about two hours and i got about halfway before i was like yo i i'm just going into this loop of just not knowing how to continue on and while also producing the best quality code that's the thing you want to produce the best quality code during these hackings not just solve the problem but it's also hard because you have this when you're on hacker rank there's this like clock in front of you that's just ticking down by the second and it's just this big red reminder of basically your hopes and dreams slipping away like like there's no like that's how it feels and so my time ran out and i didn't finish it but i was like you know what it ain't much but it's honest to work so sent that over and was mentally preparing for my next day of interviews my super day so now is the day it's game day like we out here coin toss flip everything so it's game day and my first interview was a technical which i was supposed to go over the solution um i produced this previous day through the hacker and walk through it with them and they would give me a question um as well and i would answer it on the spot i won i was so nervous because that morning so that morning before the interview even started i get an email and the email is like oh hackering score and everything i'm like perfect i see this email y'all i got a zero out of 75. that was my score that hackard gave me a zero out of 75. now i remind you i got about halfway through the problem but it looks like these people didn't care it looks like hackering did not care you know you didn't solve the problem so it's a zero so that was you know when i thought my heart dropped especially because like i was over here like with you know baking my eyes and like all that my hair up like with my beauty blender preparing for this interview and then i see this email and i'm just like i might as well not even show up i might as well not even go like a zero zero out of 75 and so i was very yeah very very scared but um funny enough so this this let this serve as a lesson to you all funny enough i get to the technical portion of the super day and they actually um my interviewers actually say that they were impressed by how far i got so keep this in mind y'all sometimes the problems you get are not meant to be solved they are problems that the company is expecting you not to solve and really what they might be testing is your ability to go about problem solving when you're you know in high pressure situations your ability to think about uh ways to solve it even though you don't know how but think about what approaches you could take um and all of that sometimes it's not actually meant to be solved so next time you're struggling during a coding interview just have that attitude like you know what they're not expecting me to solve this so let me make sure i show them anyway what type of engineer i am and the way i go about my problem solving you know process and things like that next was a portion where we were put into teams and we had to basically produce like a case solution um to a problem we got from the interviewers and so if you've ever done like a case study or if you've ever done like business challenge problems it was like this where they give you a problem and you conduct a whole full solution procedural financials um and put in a presentation and then you at the end of the day you would end up presenting it um in front of the like 50 60 different members of the teams so this one this part was okay um i remember like making sure i like stayed active and you know stay active but not you know trumping other people's ideas because that's not good that's not what a leader is you don't trump people's ideas but staying active and being able to facilitate conversation and discussion so that was like really like what i was trying to do there so that was okay then i go to my behavioral and so i get to my behavioral and for the most part it was good so for me behavioral interviews for me is like what carries the team um because i know i do get frenzied with technical questions and things like that um i know i get like very panicky that i can't even think but behavioral i just like to show who i am as a person i like to share what i've done in the past and share what i'm looking to do in this company and so i like behavioral in that way and behavioral has liked me in that way however so this this entire video is going to be like however like that's gonna be this entire conversation however with this behavioral interview i kept like i don't know i think it was because i just wanted this company so bad i would kind of like say something then like get into this like hole of like spiraling and just talking and like out i could hear myself talk and then like out of me would kind of like move away and be like yo like stop talking like like end of the question and i and i would just like try to now wrap it up because i see this out of me saying yo what are you doing like stop it and everything and so like just like yeah talking and just like trying to just trying to show these people who i am so after that behavioral then we're supposed to go back into our teams for the case analysis go have another like maybe hour to go through there before we present this is where all hell broke loose y'all like all hell i lose my internet so this is something you know i you know forget um when listening to stories where you know in a parallelogram and a panda bear all that and so everything was virtual i didn't you know get flown out to the offices or you know to the company for these interviews everyone was virtual so i was in my basement [Music] yeah and i'm just like what happened to my internet like nothing is working nothing is working i had so flashback to my other three interviews with different companies i have a two-year-old baby brother y'all he is a very adorable like light of my life except for the times where he comes into my interviews and i if my parents are watching this like you know you know how i feel about this i have because at the time um i was living at home i no longer live my home by the time i was living at home and so i would tell them like yo like i'm going to be an interview in an interview from this time to this time make sure the baby's away and like please be quiet like because you could hear footsteps like crazy you could hear if people were talking if people were if the baby was crying you could hear it and you could through a computer as well and i was like please like be quiet and like just let me have these 30 minutes these this one hour three times my baby brother has come into my interviews and i'm like yo like where were you i told you like this is my job i'm trying to get a job and you can't watch this two-year-old for 30 minutes like please please watch him and so um for this interview because they knew you know how much i wanted this they decided to just leave the house they were like you know what we're not even going to be around because every time we're around something goes wrong so they all left they all left except for my dad my dad had um i believed worked the night before and so he just you know he needed his rest and so he was um in their room sleeping so but everyone else is away so the internet goes out and i'm like oh my god like i need so first thing i do is i text the recruiter and i'm like yo i'm so sorry like my internet's not working i'm gonna like i'm gonna call the provider and see what's going on i run upstairs to my dad and i'm like the internet is out like like what what's going on and so he calls the provider and they're like this says your internet is fine and everything and so then they try to like reboot everything and i'm i keep just texting my recruiter like i'm so sorry i'm supposed to be meeting with my team to practice our presentation um which is like one of the like most important parts of that interview and everything like i'm just like please like i beg of you get get back and get this internet back and everything an hour goes by and now i have like i was like 10 minutes before not even 10 minutes y'all like an hour goes by and so i missed the slot for me to meet with my team on our presentation and now teams are actively presenting to um the boards and like the workers of this company and everything and so after an hour of like just cons like going back and forth in all of this i get my bag i get my computer and i drive i get out the door and i drive like a mad woman to my nearest starbucks luckily i live like two and a half minutes from a starbucks so it really took like no time at all especially with the way i was driving up in these streets so i drove drove drove and set my computer down put up the wife because i knew starbucks had free wi-fi and so put up you know my laptop to get free wi-fi and everything and i show up um show up but you know i get to the video stream or whatever the virtual meeting of you know this last section of the interview which was the presentation and it was so embarrassing because now i got there literally just in time for us to present and it sounds like i'm saying like oh this time but really it was like 30 minutes no i was just in time i get there i text my recruiter i'm like i'm here i'm here and everything and um you know now we're supposed to be presenting it was so embarrassing because i get there and my team is like hey nya um you are doing slides at five and six in front of everybody like in front of like the and i'm not blaming my team but i'm saying more of a thing of like now like how like everyone knows my how i'm unprepared for this and so i'm in front of 50 60 people and i have no idea what slide five and six are so now i have to pull up the slides um the google's luckily it was google slides like no one had to send me anything so the automatic you know loading and all allowed me to see the most recent version of the presentation look up slides five and six and i like you know i'm reading it over and i'm just trying to like see how to present it in a way that shows i'm not just reading off of it and i'm actually you know i actually have some cells up in here too and you know show that i would be a great person for this company and so you know now it's my turn for the slides and i talk and i try to add in some background information just from what i know of the company and then you know i breathe a little bit like okay like my part is done and um yes then we're done presenting they asked a question um just like you know those like panel questions you know so they ask a question and i made sure you can best believe i made sure to answer that question and so i made your chance of the question um talking about like more like inclusivity and all of this and they're like thank you like that was great and so now i'm in my car waiting for the phone call as to if i would get the job or not the reason i was waiting in my car is because i had an offer expiring 30 minutes after the end of this super day and i had said this to the recruiter that i have an offer expiring just 30 minutes after please tell me as soon as possible if i get this job because if i don't then i'll i'll take this other one but i want you um so i'm just i couldn't even bring myself to start driving like i sit in my car and i call a few friends and i'm just crying just saying like how bad this day was like everything like just bad bad bad and how just frenzied i was from everything from the technical interview me you know showing me starting out with the xerox 75 to then lights literally going out you know and me having no way of you know being a part of this interview because now i don't have internet don't have you know all of this and having to drive to starbucks where everyone sees i'm at a starbucks everyone sees i'm at this public location with literally i remember the symbol with bruno mars playing in the background when i'm trying to give my portion of the presentation like it was just like i was just crying and so then um i get a call from my recruiter and he's like hey yeah um the thing about my recruiter so i have loved interacting um with this recruiter he is someone who obviously cares about the applicants and you know contenders is that i feel like i'm talking about like hunger games when i say the word contenders but about the future you know employees of this company the future engineers and so he is someone that like i also just didn't want to disappoint you know what i mean because like now we have been talking for like a month now from my first interview to now um and like i just now didn't want to let him down and so i remember listening to him um and like he had like a very monotone like voice and so i was just like it's over it's over it's over like you should just text me the rest like you don't need to tell me like how you chose someone else like um but he's like yeah so you know we loved and you know we'd love for you to work with us and this is the salary and we'll send you more information later and i'm like okay i'll talk to you later goodbye and i was just shaking i remember screaming have you guys seen that video if you haven't seen this video please look it up um it's this woman who got out of um an interview and um like got on a call like on the phone the person said she got the job or something or she walked out of the building having gotten the job and she stops in the parking lot and it's just like dancing look it up look up like maybe like woman who gets a job dancing in parking lot it is the funniest video that was me out and it's funny because like this happened like a week within each other so i remember that i remembered that video in that moment but i was just like like in my car and i remember just like yeah like if someone's looking at me in my car just like going wild like i was just so happy and i have not lost that feeling since then just so happy looking back i do see how like being hard on myself negatively um impacted the experience because like they um very much put weight on like trying to make this as enjoyable as possible for people it is you know six hours but it's six hours for a reason they're trying to get you to know more about the company and for the different departments and different department heads and co-workers to know about more about you in the most fun way possible and so i wish like knowing what i know now about like what they truly wanted to see out of me which was you know potential for growth in a person who they would just like to work with i would have you know been much less hard on myself and that much less like in my head um but no i am so so grateful for that experience for this company like i am so excited to work for them and i'm so grateful for my recruiter if my crew is watching this like i'm so grateful for you um and i look forward to speaking with you soon i still you know i hope you're doing well i do think about um yeah the next time we get to talk and interact because like speaking with you know the different members of this company and you know the recruiters and the managers it was just like it's looks like such a family and such an amazing community and so i'm very very grateful to be a part of that and so yeah that is my six hour interview story um my super day on the day of the super bowl story um so no i hope you all enjoyed this like more relaxed conversation and yeah subscribe if you'd like to you know just hang out some more you know be a part of this community and i'll see y'all soon bye"}
