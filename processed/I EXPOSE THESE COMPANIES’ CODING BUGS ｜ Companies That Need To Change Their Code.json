{"video_title": "I EXPOSE THESE COMPANIES\u2019 CODING BUGS \uff5c Companies That Need To Change Their Code", "transcript": "and you forget you come back you go open your email and boom you hear ray's been shot well thanks hulu like great great let me also this is a disclaimer i don't work for any of these companies i don't know any of their code this is truly just me as a consumer uh me and my grievances hello everybody my name is nyan i'm the black female engineer i provide content for new and aspiring software engineers and today we are talking about some companies that uh need to fix a few things in their code this these are things that i've just been thinking about for like up to a year every time i see something pop up and whatnot and i i just get it just irks me and it's funny because it very much is that software developer mind uh in me because now i do certain things and i'm like wow they should really change their code for x y and z let me know in the comments below what things you notice and what things you agree with and what things you don't and so first of all let's start with mercedes benz i got a new car recently about uh three months ago and it is a mercedes benz i am very happy about it because it was a goal i've had for the last like eight years and so i was really really happy that i finally got to do it there's this specific thing that happens though with my car so i have the gla 250 and one thing that was very important to me was the speaker system of the car i was getting when i was looking at new cars and testing your cars and everything i would put the volume up try to see like oh he doesn't have a good base does it have good surround sound and whatnot can we feel good going to the club in this car and that is true however my car does the specific thing where you're listening to a song right and then let's say you're trying to skip songs so you're listening to a song and you press that like fast 40 button or the next button on the display where it typically says the artist the song title and all that when you click next now on the display it says track plus one and then it goes to the next track now i don't know if y'all are thinking what i'm thinking but i'm thinking someone left a print statement somewhere in there in their code someone left a console log somewhere um because to me that's not what it should do because that's what the code is doing it's looking at the track which is i in my opinion track is equal to the certain the the current song playing and then on click on click of this button on click do track plus one and it goes to the next track and so that's how imagine the code is working out i think someone left a console log somewhere there because i shouldn't see that because you don't have to tell me that it's going to track plus one or the next song but if you wanted to like let's say the programmers really were like no we need to show them that you know we are sticking with what they want us to do and we are going to the next track then ideally what you would say is display on the screen playing next track or skipping or next you wouldn't put track plus one it's literally track plus one i'll try to add a picture somewhere around here or video or of some kind so if someone working at mercedes is watching this video please uh update that and when you do let me know so i can put my car up and we can we can fix all that next company on the list is bumble yes bumble the dating app meant for like women to take the first move which is a whole thing in itself but that's let's talk for another day in bumble this is super recent i started noticing this only about two weeks ago because i know this wasn't a thing but true before then now if you have matches right like matches in your page race you see like okay i have matches with like let's say these three people despite having these matches set you may still want to swipe and see what other matches you get just you know because it's a free country bumble now has it so that if you're swiping and you have matches like matches waiting is what uh i believe the exact term they use if you're swiping after like your tenth swipe-ish um in your current session it will pop it'll like interrupt you and like put up this pop-up and be like hey you have matches waiting how about you go message those people like like if you don't get the if you don't get out and let me continue my swiping i'm going to throw like i'm going to throw you away like i can't stand that like i'll be just like in a rhythm right and then just like alert like the if you've seen the circle it's like alert and like you have matches waiting i just feel so judged almost like you have matches waiting like what what the hell are you doing swiping all up in here like can you not tell me what to do and like i'm making this way deeper than it is but it's just something that annoys me a lot and i'm sure this is all done within some type of if statement like if user has matches but is swiping after 10 swipes insert this alert how about we take that whole part out like if these are swiping leave them alone like let's let's just not and so yes that is my grievance number two that is yeah with bumble and then last but certainly not least because this is something that has been bothering me for years years years because this has always been a thing with hulu i don't know if other people have noticed this but hulu right and there to be honest on this there are a couple of things um that should be fixed uh with hulu's app but again that's a conversation for a different day this specific thing however i can't let go any longer on hulu if you're watching a show right say you're watching you know the good doctor which i've actually been watching a ton if you you know follow me on instagram you know that follow me on instagram by the way it's at the black female engineer but yes anyway if you are watching a show say the good doctor and let's say you pre you put pause right you click pause uh because you realize you need to go do some other things you click pause put your laptop away and go hop in your mercedes to go on the bumble date you just scheduled so you come back this is hours later it was a good day you come back and you turn on your laptop and you're trying to just uh let's say you write an email you turn on your laptop you go to your email and you start hearing something you start hearing like dialogue and whatnot you realize it's the good doctor playing why is a good doctor playing it's on pause you're on pause why are you playing i'm not even on the screen hulu somewhere on somewhere on line 652 of media dot p y they have and you know this just be speculating they have a function and actually it wouldn't even be like media.py it'd be like media.js uh the code i'm thinking they have a line of code that's that that says on page load window.onload i think is the exact syntax like window.onload play because simply by you turning on your computer and your browsers are like really loading um like turning on because yeah you've been gone for a while hulu starts playing the show you are on this it doesn't matter if you put pause on it it doesn't matter if you didn't put pause on it doesn't matter if when you open your laptop you're on the excel spreadsheet or you open your laptop and now you're on hulu no matter what on page load the media starts playing why why like i can't stand this and let's say what if you had paused it before this like super good scene that you were like you know what like i need to go on this date so let me wait to reveal who you know is about to get murdered or whatever now i guess we're not talking about the good doctor this is i don't know how to get away with murder but let me pause before i see who gets murdered let me run to this date and you know when i come back and everything and you forget you come back you go open your email and boom you hear ray's been shot thanks hulu like it's great great like now i don't even need to put play again and watch you so another one i don't know why i'm getting so actually i do know why i'm getting so worked up with this because i truly find it absurd i hate this part of hulu so much and it's funny because now i am working in the media realm and yeah there's a lot that comes into um yeah making apps like this and everyday and so please know that i am not uh trying to say that anyone is a bad developer or you know y'all working hard like i know believe me i know this is just a fun light-hearted video where i just share a few things in hopes that maybe something gets fixed like a one percent hope that someone's watching this who can actually address these matters but really just to all in all share that yeah when you have a profession when you spend 40 hours a week doing something you start seeing the world a lot differently you start thinking about the code that goes into the daily things you love and the technologies you use and everything it's very interesting i imagine if you're a barista and you make all these coffees all the time you now have a very specific taste when it comes to coffee and you know that oh they use the one percent milk instead of two percent and everything like you just start knowing these things and so it's very funny um to see that that is what has become of me please let me know what things you agreed with what things you didn't uh what things you maybe didn't notice before but now that i said it you see it or notice it and yeah just your thoughts if there are other companies that you have thoughts like this with please please please let me know in the comments because i'd love to get that like fun dialogue going and maybe make this uh more into like more videos and do like part two part three part four so let me know in the comments below but don't forget to subscribe and like the video and i will see you all later bye"}
