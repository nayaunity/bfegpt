provide content for new and aspiring software engineers and today we're going to be talking about how to prepare for the software engineering job hunt we're going to go into five key things that you need to do before you even start applying so that you can really hit the ground running and get a job as soon as possible but i have a quick favor to ask of you all i finally created an instagram because i wanted to make sure that i was engaging with you all and talking with you all as much as possible so i created an instagram and i want to create a q a video so head on over there this is my handle at the black female engineer and so go over there and dm me any questions you have about me about software engineering coding boot camps and everything in between and i'll put them into a fun q a video where i answer them directly and give y'all a shout out too so without further ado let's get to so the first thing you need to do before you start applying to jobs is create three and yes i said it three different resumes now why three because if you are applying for software engineering roles there's three main targets that you may be looking at you may be looking at front end back end full stack and with those three different targets comes a different resume where you list the technologies applicable for those different topics or you list the experience you have or you really just make sure you refine and optimize your resume in a way that it highlights that full stack position that front-end position that backhand position and so i know people say oh you know tailor each one of your resumes for each application yo i applied to almost 100 jobs and if i tailored each and every one of those resumes for each application yo i wouldn't have gone to 100 i would have only applied to a couple a week because that's like applying to jobs is a full-time job in itself and so i say just keep it at three so that depending on which role you are applying to you can just look which resume is best and select that one this will really streamline that whole process second thing that you need to do it is very important to make sure you keep track of each of your applications and so make sure you have something in place where you can do that an excel sheet a notebook etc i use an excel sheet and i actually added a link to an excel sheet that you guys can use for your job application in the description box below i created it and it's free for download and use and everything so check that out and that hopefully is something that you can easily keep up with but if it's not if you prefer pen and paper if you prefer you know journals and everything that's totally fine but make sure you have something in place to keep up with the applications because if you see that you know six weeks have gone by and you haven't heard from that one job then hopefully you can get in contact with a recruiter to get some type of update it's important to just stay aware of the status of your applications where you are in certain stages and if you apply to a hundred and seven weeks have gone by and you haven't heard back from any of them then you can make the decision of okay maybe i should retailer my resume maybe you know ask people what they think about my applications and things like that so you see what um is maybe hurting you in this application so keep up that tracking so you can keep up with your metrics and all of that number three optimize your github recruiters look at your github because they want to see your coding habits your coding structures how often you code and what your primary languages are for coding yes they have your resume but they also like to back things up with your actual activity and github is a great place for that so make sure you optimize your github i have a link above that really goes into how to edit your github profile what you should add what you shouldn't have to really make sure that when recruiters see it then they decide to bring you in for an interview afterwards so go check that out but yes optimize your github so just a friendly reminder to click that subscribe button because it really helps me out it really helps more people get to my channel and that's what we're trying to do we're really just assist in the transition to software engineering especially if you're a woman especially if you're a person of color trying to make sure that these tips are getting out to as many people as possible because we want to see more inclusivity in this field so please help me out with that but let's get to number four so the fourth thing you need to do is create a list of people that you personally know that could assist in your job hunt process in some way it can be something as direct as oh my friend emma works at this software company let me let her know that i'm applying let me ask for any tips that she may have and ask if um yeah what she thinks of my resume and things like that or it can be more indirect of oh my mom has you know a friend who works at this company let me let my mom know that i am you know really looking and asking if you know she'd be open to getting me connected with this person so just make sure you keep that list and follow up with those people on that list now what we're not going to do is ask for a job we don't ask for jobs here there's a saying ask for a job get advice ask for advice get a job so when you go to these people and say hey i'd really love it if you could you know look over my resume since you're in this field i'm looking i'd really like to see your insights or see what you think about my project by doing that people will automatically if they love you you know if if they love you they automatically will put your hat in the ring like oh you're looking yeah let me look at that resume and then after we look at it let me actually submit it to you in my company that is how this goes but we don't say hey is your job hiring i'd love to get a job because then they'll say oh just make sure you apply and everything do you see how those are two very different responses yeah so we ask for advice write that list and follow up with those people and even if they don't get you in the door there hopefully is some type of insight they can give you that other people now don't have so that is number four and finally number five is to optimize your linkedin account make sure that your profile picture is something that you know is professional it doesn't have to be you out here in a suit and tie and all of that but something professional something high quality make sure that your about me section is updated and says what you're looking for in a job and make sure that your previous experience and your projects are on there and things like that linkedin i can talk about it always till sunday i can really go into that so if you would like a video like how i did my github how i did my resume if you would like a linkedin video let me know please like this video that way i know what you guys want but if not totally fine we'll just keep pushing so there we have it the five things i need y'all to do before you start going through that job on process before you start applying to jobs don't forget i do have that link below of that spreadsheet you can use to track your job process your job application process and hunt and all of that completely free just you know follow the instructions and it's yours so no thanks you guys so much for watching and i'll see y'all later good luck"}
