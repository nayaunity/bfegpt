new and aspiring software engineers and today is very exciting because we're talking about money we're talking about that cash and really just going into salary and offer negotiations so let's get to it actually before i get to it i need to just i need to just put this disclaimer out that i am not a professional mentor i'm not you know uh licensed anything i am just sharing my own tips and advice from my own teachings my own experience and hope that you can add any of these things to your toolkit to help you out in the future so keep that in mind okay now let's get to it so first things first you got the job congratulations that is something that's super exciting and worth celebrating no matter what because it's hard y'all up in the street it's so congratulations so they gave you you know they said we are looking to hire you we would love to give you this offer first things first never and i mean never accept an offer over the phone i don't care if they offer you five hundred thousand dollars do not accept an offer over the phone simply say thank you and you know acknowledge you know the time y'all have spent together interviewing and everything and hang up that phone and and wait for the official package or anything to come or just give yourself time to think about things next rule never ever be the first to give numbers for what you're looking for in your offer if they ask you either before you know the official interviews or after you get the job because i've been asked you know even during app applying or during my first interview do not give them a straight answer when asked what are you looking for in terms of compensation in terms of salary what i say and y'all might drag me for this what i say is well i'm looking for whatever is fair and equitable given the position company location of this opportunity that is it that's all i say because no way am i going into this trap of being lowballed because i gave the wrong number so that is what i do now let's say because some of these recruiters man like will just keep on like getting at you and everything what if they say okay we understand that but we need a number okay give them a range i'm looking for anything between 75 and 100 000 depending on location and position sorry not sorry because salary isn't just the number you need to look at so many different things to see what actually is a right salary seventy five thousand dollars in nebraska is way different than seventy five thousand dollars in new york heck seventy five thousand dollars in nebraska is way different than one hundred thousand dollars in new york in terms of you know actual cash you'll get to see nebraska is still better in terms of you know what you'll take home and you know live the cost of living and all of this so you need to do your research you need to see where is this position located and what is the um like the average salary the average compensation for somebody in my position or in the position that i'm applying to interviewing for in this location that way when an interviewer asks you what you're looking for you give them oh well given the ranges i have seen through research this range to this range is where i'd be looking to start off negotiations that is how you start off that process now if we talk about what um resources that are available for that research glassdoor yo i use glassdoor like is running out of style like i use glassdoor for everything and i have found it to be very reliable but um if you're looking for something a lot more concrete one great great resource is levels.fyi i'll link those two below along with some more but levels.fyi is great because they go through a very robust um confirmation process in making sure that what you're reporting is your salary for this one company or this one location is correct and accurate and you're not lying you're not you know doing anything wild so they you can really really trust those numbers so i highly recommend those resources again i'll link them below but make sure you do that research so they know you can't just be hoodwinked and swindled when you know that this company paid their last 10 engineers 200 000 meanwhile they're offering you 64 000 like no so going into negotiations so first make sure this is face to face or you know because of this panda bear make sure it is green to screen because it's a lot easier to have true genuine and honest conversations that way and by doing that you can look out for non-verbal cues you can look out for you know if they are you know look in some type of way if they're you know hesitating or everything you can see that a lot better by you know webcams i feel old saying that i think that's the right term um by you know zoom in all of those those types of meetings do not do email and if you can stay away from it don't do phone calls seriously do a face-to-face screen to screen conversation so they say we are so excited to offer you this position here is the salary we would have you for so you see the salary i you'll see um different uh advice on this i personally have never negotiated right there and then after seeing the salary i've never just said hold up i want x y and z i've never done that instead i've been like okay thank you um i just need you know give me one day and i'll get back to you then in that day i am talking to everybody and their mama trying to make sure i get a whole picture of this company a whole picture of um their previous you know salary history and you know things like the previous research i talked about bonus points if you can find somebody who has worked at that company or has worked in your position to give you their numbers as to what they get paid this just provides some insight into what's realistic and what's not this is something i personally very much encourage especially amongst you know us women and us people of color that is something i very very much encourage and so try to seek um someone out to just give you who also you know works at the position it doesn't have to be the same company but who also works in the same type of position you are looking to work in or you just got your offer for try to see what their numbers are don't pressure them to tell you but if they are willing then that would be great but this one day passes and you say thank you know amanda for this offer i'd love to talk about talk more in detail about it face to face here's my availability and schedule a meeting so now you're in this meeting and now it is time for you to bring forth like like a lawyer bring forth the discovery of these last few you know hours and days bring up the research you found so saying you offered me let's let's work with a number it's easier to work with a number let's say 85 000. you offered me 85 000 however through my research i saw that the average salary range is between you know 85 000 and 95 000 um i would like to see that number go up to that 95 000 number and just a side note if you are applying to a job or just you know got hired for a job that is in a different location than you are now than than you currently live in use a calculator to see what the pay conversion is so basically let's say i got you know a job for los angeles and it's for eighty thousand dollars i currently let's say live in nebraska and i you know have i know what my rent looks like and i do i use this calculator to see that in a shoot what was the number i said was it 75 000 let's say it was 75 000. i use the calculator to see that a 75 salary in california is equivalent to a 42 000 salary in nebraska let's say that's what it converts i don't know if that's what it converts to but let's say that's what it converts now ask yourself would you accept a 42 000 salary in nebraska would you if you would then you're in a good spot but would you and think about the type of life you would have with a 42 000 in salary in nebraska and now think about that with california that is the same type of life you would have in terms of you know food and going out and rent and you know your flexibility or inflexibility so make sure you use this conversion and make sure you bring this up in your salary negotiation if this applies to you say look this is where i live this is what you're offering me and the conversion doesn't sit right with me i want x amount of money to make sure i sustain the life i'm currently living now let's say they are first like nah son nope you you aren't qualified enough for this type of pay or you know for this pay enhancement well y'all remember this don't ever let a company tell you that you are not worth x amount of money they hired you do they not they you know obviously saw your qualifications and saw that you were the right fit even if let's say their job description at first said they want somebody with four years of experience and you only have two and a half or three years of experience and that's what they use to say oh that's why we can't pay you x amount but you still hired me so you're obviously you know knowing that i am qualified and i am the person for the job because i did these type of projects i put on these types of initiatives and um in my two and a half years i've done these to the programs and that is equivalent to what you would have wanted to see someone with four years anyway so remind them that be swift and smooth to remind them that but yes the next is making sure you present your credentials and saying why you are worth it why you are worth in terms of technical skill in terms of leadership experience and also in terms of culture and what you are hoping to see um yourself how you're hoping to see yourself grow within this company so let's say you did all of this and they're like sorry like what we offered you is our best offer this may not be a lie sometimes companies really do give their best offer so don't think you're being you know swindled or had ranked or anything but there are other things to negotiate other than just cash you can negotiate vacation days flex time you can negotiate um education assistance along with stock you can negotiate also the location if you are if you apply to um a company that gave a bunch of location ranges you can negotiate the location you want to be in and you can negotiate the team you want to work with or the technologies you want to work with if they just said you know oh full stack developer or something um you can say i want to specifically work in the front end team in you know with react with the back end you can negotiate all of these different things and when you rack them up they can end up being worth the same or more than the cash itself so make sure you remember that so look at okay what is something that i would value most of this list of things what is something i would value most would i value vacation days you would i value work from home days you know the flexibility to work from home especially if you're getting this position you know during a pain to bear you can say when it is back to working in the office i would still like the chance to work 50 from home you can negotiate all of these things and that could give you better um luck in you know this whole offer negotiation situation another thing that i just forgot to mention you can also negotiate a sign-on bonus so you can't get you know let's say you can't get that extra five thousand ten in your salary but let's say you can get that five thousand in a one-time bonus negotiate that as well or if they already gave you it ask for more so just remember there are other things you can negotiate but at the end of it all if you don't feel good about this offer you can also negotiate the expert of the offer so let's say they say you have one week to accept a decline ask for three weeks if you know that you have certain interviews coming up or you apply to a job that you're excited about and um are you know hoping to hear back from them soon you can ask for you know three more weeks if they ask for why you need three more weeks be forthcoming be forthcoming but fake um i like something i like to say is well in three weeks that's when i will have the necessary information for me to accept or deny this offer with confidence and usually most of the time they give you some type of extension maybe not the full three weeks or the full time that you asked for that they most of the time are willing to work with you then y'all don't be afraid to then after you know let's say they gave you 10 days instead of three weeks at the end of those 10 days ask for another 10 days because here's the thing you have the upper hand in this companies spend so much money when it comes to recruitment that when they finally have somebody that they want to hire they they're not gonna just that's something people are afraid of that the company is just going to be like you know what never mind and we don't want to hire you anymore and you know get that is not something that you shouldn't be afraid of and honestly if a company does do that then you know that they were going to drop you in the drop of a hat anyway you did not have job security anyway because if asking questions and asking for flexibility makes them take away your offer oh nah goodbye goodbye so just keep asking and so ask for extensions so you can make sure that you're making the best possible decision for you and at the end of the day if you know that you would feel bad about yourself or feel sick at the idea of walking into this office every day being paid what you end up being paid then that is not a a company you should accept that's not an offer you should accept now of course people have different circumstances in which they have to accept certain things but if you have the flexibility not to give yourself you know say you know what thank you for this experience thank you for the interviews i enjoyed meeting you but i have to sadly or unfortunately decline and just bet on yourself y'all that's something that i say all the time to people close to me and you know i'm saying to y'all bet on yourself don't think that this is the only job that's going to come around a company will come that sees your value and can match what you see as your value and then some so make sure that you at the end of the day are doing the best thing for you but also for your peace of mind but there we go everybody my tips for offering negotiation and if you like this video or like any of the tips i shared please click that
