provide content for new and aspiring software engineers and today we're talking about the five projects to have in your portfolio to just give you the best odds when you start job hunting and really start putting yourself out there so what are they the first type of project you want is a copycat project now i'm not talking about plagiarism or anything like that let's make that very clear but create something that already exists so let's say for example tinder but for activism and make the layout similar and all of that because when you show this out it'll show employers wow she can make something that took a whole team to create now i'm not saying have all the bells and whistles and everything but show that you understand the basic functionalities and what would make this app run because you don't have a team you don't have a full team so i'm not saying act like you do but show that you can and have the potential to work on projects like this and the best way to do that is with a copycat and say look you i am applying to tinder.com well look here here is my version of tinderbot for activism so i obviously am the person for the job it really shows that you know how to make the top apps that are out in the world today you know how to bring those types of apps to life you know those core functionalities and what it takes to make them run and that is very desirable in an employee the next app you want to create is some type of search engine app now this sounds very boring but i promise you it's not one example could be a search engine but for games that's actually something i did with a team it was a search engine for board games that's rules for board games so you could look up let's say like scrabble and it would show you all the different scrabble games how much they were their description and how many um are able to play at it another example could be a recipe app which is something i also created something that uses an api data that you have to manipulate you have to fetch for you have to use and integrate into your app because being able to work with apis is such a fundamental skill such a core skill and you want to really exhibit that you can do that instead of people who are maybe new to development what you may be doing right now is creating all that data yourself well there's a lot of resources for you out there of apis that are already available for you for the most obscure types of apps i'll actually add a link below of different apis you can access about half of the apps i've built were from a list of these apis so i'll link them below and you see it doesn't have to be something boring when people see here a search engine they think google that doesn't have to be it it can be recipes it could be board games it could be pokemon characters it could be all these different things that someone can search on their browser and it pulls up all these different pokemon characters and all of that the next project you want is a social media project so this doesn't have to be you know the next instagram or the next you know facebook or anything just something with the basic core functionalities of social media so what are those being able to post something either pictures or updates or status being able to like something of somebody else's comment and delete things these are also known as crud functionalities create read update and delete being able to show that you can build an app with these functionalities which is the same functionalities that all of the social media apps in the world have is very very important and you can put your own spin on it so again it doesn't have to be the next instagram the next xyz it could be social media for i don't even know quidditch players or something some type of social media i don't know i don't even i yeah so it can be make things fun it's so easy to just get wrapped up in creating these things with all these bells and whistles just make sure you're making things fun make things according to your interests and things like that the fourth type of app you want in your portfolio is some type of financial app now why do we want finance in here because we want our portfolio to be the most versatile and diverse portfolio it can be where we can send our portfolio to bank of america and to you know facebook and to uber and they all see something that they like in there and so that's where the financial app comes in it shows that you can work with financial calculations you can work with numbers and so what examples of finance apps are there we can do a personal finance tracker something i also did we can do a budgeter where a person inputs their lifestyle their habits and their optimum budget pops up for them you can also do some type of stock tracker some type of stock visualization there are so many different ways it doesn't just have to be like oh a finance tracker and everything there's so many different ways to go about this and again have fun with it put your own spin on things and then lastly you need y'all y'all listen to this you need a passion project you want to show these people that you are a person with goals with dreams and passions it humanizes you it puts you away from just being some other applicant number 58692 to being naya to being stacy jeremiah you are now a person and it creates a great connection for interviews being able to talk about this passion project because for me i had a passion project that when i started talking about it in interviews you can see that passion you can it was exuding out of me out of every sweat gland like you could see it and so being able to really have something that you can be proud of and it makes learning new technologies and frameworks and features easier because you're passionate about it so make sure that in the midst of all of this you're not forgetting about your own passion projects now youtube tells me that 70 of you aren't even subscribed and
