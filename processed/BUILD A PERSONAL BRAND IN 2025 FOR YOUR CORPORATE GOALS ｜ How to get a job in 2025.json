{"video_title": "BUILD A PERSONAL BRAND IN 2025 FOR YOUR CORPORATE GOALS \uff5c How to get a job in 2025", "transcript": "resumes don't cut it anymore okay it sucks it sucks it sucks it sucks hello everybody my name is Nia and I'm the black female engineer I provide C for new and aspiring software engineers and today we are talking about building your personal brand for 2025 Corporate America because that is really what is going to take now to elevate your career get that job get that promotion and be seen as a person who can get the job done so let's get right into to it I became a software engineer back in 2020 after going to a coding boot camp I had had a finance background and was like you know what this isn't for me but I believe software engineering is and I was right that being said however because I knew I was at a disadvantage not having a computer science degree I needed to establish myself as someone who knows their and to do that I started posting on platforms like LinkedIn and medium at least weekly I would go on LinkedIn and talk about what I learned what projects I'm creating and try to make connections wherever I could with people working in the jobs that I would like to work at on medium also about on a weekly basis I would post an article about something technical something that I just did I remember I did an article about I think it was using some like was it graphql or some type of API to integrate graphing into one of the apps I had created so I basically provided a whole tutorial for how I did did that but if I had gotten the computer science degree in 2020 and was now looking for a job I never would have even thought to do those things I was doing those things purely out of being at a disadvantage but I'm here to tell you that now in good Lords 2025 you need to do it too degree boot camp self- teing and I'm going to make a grand statement that no matter what industry you're in if you're in Corporate America your brand needs to pretty much be the same thing and that is a person who knows their if I'm in marketing I need to be a marketing girlly that knows what she's talking about if I'm in Tech I'm a person that needs to show that I am knowledgeable on all the emerging Tech and Trends and so when I say building a brand for Corporate America I mean that how can people look at you and say oh that person over there oh oh oh they know their so for this we're going to need to focus on two things your online presence and your physical presence starting with your online presence that is your social media platforms this being one of them we're on YouTube that's one Tik Tok Instagram LinkedIn medium substack there's so many of them we need to start posting um the whole time of feeling cringed out or shy when it comes to content and things like that that is back gone like anyone who thinks that making content is cringe they're the weird ones and the again good Lords 2025 so if that is the thing that's going to stop you from continuing on this video and this path and doing these things do not let it be because now you're going to be the cringey one thinking that this is cringe okay let me calm down a little bit I get passionate what's really great is with the tools I mentioned there's kind of something for I'm not going to say everybody but something that's more easily digestible for each type of Creator right there's long form video content that I just mentioned there's long form written content there's short form video content and short form written content so with that in mind let's think about what we would be most comfortable with and it may seem obvious to some like oh obviously I would do short form content or obviously I would do written because then you're not seeing my face but actually because all of us have different skill sets and different things that make us uncomfortable we would probably be shocked and actually may you please please please let me know in the comments I want to see if I'm right about this please put in the comments what even if you don't do this at all what platform you would be most comfortable posting on if you had to had to had to it is the law now to start posting content which platform would you want to do that on start with one platform which ever one you're most comfortable with and dive deep on it I'm going to get into what diving deep means with the different platforms for example posting once a week on YouTube is fine meanwhile you need to post way more than once a week on Tik talk so we're going to go into that soon however I do want to first talk about what you're going to be posting when it comes to content we can post a million different things however let's try to think about what would be best for getting you to the goal that we want to get to which is people seeing you as a thought leader as knowledgeable Etc so each time we post content let's think about these three buckets one what is something that we saw recently whether in the news or just a trend that we're seeing what do we think about those things to be a thought leader you we need to have thoughts right right so what do we think about this new thing that's one two what are you doing right now in your current work that made you think made you learn something new or it's something that you would just like more people to know about for example something I've worked on in the past is seeing how accessible the digital assets my team had were let's say I'm looking at a page on my computer can I navigate through that page using just my keyboard that is an accessibility issue and so I was put on a task to really look at all of these and then also now fix them I can create a LinkedIn post or medium article titled six accessibility pitfalls companies are landing into with their web pages now I've just turned my work experience into something that is valuable for a lot more people not just because it's valuable what I did did but now people can learn from me right we want to teach people here and the third bucket something more micro allows to see what a day in your shoes looks like that's why Day in the Life content is so so captivating for a lot of us because it allows us to just kind of like live in someone else's shoes for a little bit and so when we can provide that micro content of saying hey let me do a quick post whether it be video or a LinkedIn post or whatever on timestamps of what I did the entire day it can provide someone insight as to what they can expect their day to be like if they had your job and that's something I love doing whenever I'm going through either career switch or pivot I love seeing hey what can I expect in a role like this and would I actually like the day byday or do I just think I would like it based on my own preconceived notions and so you may not think that going through your day byday like that is valuable but it is and here are some other content ideas that should be applicable to you no matter industry remember when I said we would talk about what diving deep means for these different platforms well here we go just like I mentioned before diving deep on YouTube is one piece of content a long form video about 7 to 15 minutes long at least you can definitely go way more than that every single week obviously it comes with its own time constraints and things like that but that is an approach with Tik Tok and Instagram I would give you the pass at five videos every week there's lots of people who would say you need to post three times a day five times a day Etc on Tik Tok and one time every single day on Instagram to actually grow your audience however I have seen that as long as you're providing value five times a week is actually quite great because the think about building our brand for corporate is value matters way more than anything else when it comes to oh make sure you turn out this Mona that matters a lot less for this reason on LinkedIn about three posts a week with be fantastic quick tip though in 2025 LinkedIn is prioritizing video content like no other and so if you can do a mix of text form content and video content that would be great and video content on LinkedIn is the exact same as Tik Tok and Instagram just a horizontal video about 60 seconds and I'm medium and substack posting an article a couple times a week would be phenomenal wherever you decide to live for the next year however May make sure that that platform has a fantastic bio think to yourself what do I want to be known for I provide content for new inlying software Engineers that is a tagline right there make sure that that tagline is in each of your bios on each of your platforms make it easy for someone to think of you the way you want to be thought about and the way to do that is to tell them how to think about you you know so that's online presence now let's talk about physical presence okay come here yes come here come here I'mma hold your hand while I say this we need to go outside anyway we got to we got to and maybe this is no problem for y'all and I really I'm holding my own hand because I'm not a person who goes outside people who know me know that very well but we need to go outside y'all companies want to hire and bring on people who make sure that they are keeping up with emerging Tech and Trends and I we already talked about this that's part of the reason we're doing but another way to show that you care about that is by physically putting yourself in environments where emerging Tech and Trends is being talked about the two main areas conferences and Industry events even if it's not as big as a conference industry events try your best your best in 2025 cuz we're we'll start are small okay go to one big conference one conference that is nationally recognized big probably cost some money however if you're currently working you can get your employer to send you there and if you're not you can likely deduct it from your taxes however do I am not a tax professional I left accounting and finance so do not take this as law okay but you can likely deduct at least partially those expenses on your tax returns go to to at least one nationally recognized conference and try to go to two other events just in your industry but can be smaller can be free can be a small group of people no bells and whistles necessary just something to really get yourself deep into your community the community of your industry talk to people connect with people after you go to those events post about what you learned at those events it's just going to be a loop after loop after Loop and that is how we establish ourselves as a thought leader and cement our personal brand as being a knowledgeable reliable person in XNX industry rumes don't cut it anymore okay it sucks it sucks it sucks it sucks I feel like about two years ago we started seeing this but we're kind of like crossing our fingers that's not true and last year was awful awful awful rumes don't cut it anymore this is what you need to get a job grow in your job grow in your field grow in your industry this is what is needed and I don't see it going away anytime soon I only see it getting more and more necessary so please do not make it harder on yourself in 2026 and 2027 when you're seeing your entire team posting Day in the Life videos and here you are wondering why you're not getting the promotion okay sorry I don't mean I don't mean to you but please okay help me help you let's do this let's get it on well you know and the truth is I can go on and on for a very long time talking about this so if there's any aspect of this you'd like me to dive deeper on I beg of you put it in the comments that way I know which things to really focus on in the part twos and threes of this video but thank you so much for watching happy 2025 and I am so excited to see yall soon"}
