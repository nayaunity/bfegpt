{"video_title": "HOW TO PREPARE FOR A TECHNICAL INTERVIEW AT A BIG COMPANY IN 10 DAYS \uff5c 9 Specific Study Steps", "transcript": "hello everybody my name is Nia and I'm the black female engineer I provide content for new and aspiring software engineers and today we're talking about how to cram for a technical interview at a top tech company in 10 days something that I very recently had to do and be comfortable with because I had exactly 10 days to cram for a coding interview and I haven't touched DS or agles or leode or none of it in four years so when I say 10 days I'm not saying oh but I've been prepping the last couple of months or weeks but I really honed down these no we're talking beginning to finishing in 10 days so let's get into it so the first stage here is gathering information and the first step for that stage is going on glass door and seeing what other people have said about the technical interview bonus points if you can specify what role you're applying for or interviewing for so for example software engineer versus backend engineer backend engineer is a lot more specific so if we can see what other people who have interviewed for backend engineer have said about the technical interview experience that'll be loads better than software engineer but sometimes we can't always get that specific so software engineer is fine see if people have shared the level of the problem they received for example lead code easy medium versus hard that's typically the standard people will base their ranking on is Le code now keep that tab open and go to Fishbowl Fishbowl was recently acquired by glass door because it kind of does the same thing provide a space where people can talk about their experiences but not just experien getting a job but also experien at a job or wanting promotions or certain hiring managers at certain companies but we can Niche Fishbowl down to see what people's interview experiences were like another great thing about Fishbowl is you can actually directly ask these questions so you can go into fishbowl like you would I don't know threads or Twitter and write an actual post saying hey does anyone have experience with so and so company for so and so job if so I would sincerely appreciate you letting me know what type of problems to prepare for so you can ask a question and also see what other people have said when they have asked a similar question which someone likely has once you have the data from those two steps make sure you copy and paste the relevant answers into your own separate document where you can keep track of what people said about the technical interview adding All Those Questions into that document is step three and now step four is get into Le code now here's where the real work begins I highly recommend and this is not sponsored by anybody but you know somebody can you know you can hit me up get Le code premium I have never had Le code premium until these 10 days where I've had to study like crazy the specific reason I got Le Cod premium was so I could study per the company questions that have been reported so let's say I'm interviewing for I'll do an easy one meta people will report what questions they were asked during technical interviews and leak code will gather that up and allow you to practice on those questions this makes studying so much easier because now you don't have to guess what is going to be given to you and you don't have to just like wish for the best it's like no this is what people have said leod is saying people have been asked and it also when you go to the company specific questions page will show you how frequently people reported being asked a certain question so you can even base your practice based off of How likely you are to receive this question at an interview well I guess that's not technically How likely you are to receive the question but it's more how many people say they received it which can be interpreted as How likely are you but you know what I mean I'm not one to get premium memberships when it comes to professional Endeavors of mine I always feel like I feel like there's a free version of what I'm looking for but when it comes to this I I feel like that just isn't the case and so that is really why I decided to commit and say you know what let me get the premium now let me put an asteris on that tip get premium if your company is in that list of available filters because maybe you're applying to I don't know glass door even though it's a big company that many of us know it may not be in the list of companies available for Leo specific problem step five now once you have those companies available to you go into that company page and filter not based on frequency asked but on acceptance because again likely we have not touched leode in a hot minute or for some reason we need to just jam-pack our studying into only a couple of days and so when you rank based on the number of times people have said they received that problem you have a high likelihood of the problems being maybe more challenging and instead we want to work our way up to those problems so I suggest ranking based on acceptance ranking based on acceptance is ranking in accordance to how many people were able to submit a right answer to that which can kind of be interpreted not as easier to hardest because that is a level but more like just capability your likelihood of being able to answer this question that's how I've always interpreted it and when you rank based on acceptance you'll see that there is a big correlation between a high acceptance level and it being an easier problem more on that remember the document we created see what level lead code problem most people reported having so for the company I'm interviewing for everywhere I've seen people have said Le code medium and including the recruiter the recruiter herself said expect aot code medium so even while I'm ranking by exceptions I'm focusing on leode medium so as I go through the problems and I get better and better at them as the days go by I don't think I'm really going to switch over too hard because it doesn't seem like there's a point to it and we're trying to be as efficient and smart about the study plan as possible now it's okay that you don't know how to solve these problems yet because step six is see how they are solved open up a problem read through it and see how you yourself a capable human being would solve that problem not in terms of code or algorithms or anything just you yourself looking at this problem so for example a common problem is sorting an array me myself is someone came up to me just on the street saying hey can you sort this array I know my process as a human being I would look at the array I would look at each number and I would see is this number less than or greater than or equal to this other number and I do that over and over again until I go through the entire list and then boom the array is sorted now that you have processed how you as a human being would solve this problem now think about a computer a computer needs very specific instructions write down step by step in your code but comment it out what you're doing to process the problem as a human then follow that up with whever you can fill it in with code so for example with the previous problem of of sorting the array sorting the list I said okay if this number is less than this number then place it here instead of there in that statement I said if I said less than those are some very specific ways to solve problems in programming there are if statements there are comparisons all the works and so what I'm trying to say is once you write down how you yourself would solve that problem see where you can place actual code in place of of your pseudo code because that's what you did you wrote some pseudo code when you can't fill in the pseudo code with real code anymore go look up the answer using chat GPT or YouTube and honestly it's more of an and or YouTube because I've been using both a lot because chat is amazing for explaining things but sometimes I can't visualize the solution and so that's where I'll go to YouTube to truly get that visualization and someone explaining it to me when you look up the solution to a problem and it still doesn't make sense for you now it's time to hone down on what doesn't make sense and learn about it for example day one I didn't understand the solutions that involved recursion and so I spent the rest of the day learning about recursion looking up YouTube videos asking chat to teach me looking up more practice problems and also seeing what courses were out there to better explain recursion I don't recommend buying the courses like I did because they often are very beginner level though at least that's how the experience has been for me and we need something way more advanced for what we're trying to do once you understand how that solution came about now you can move on to the next problem again in the first few days don't Focus too much on knowing exactly how to solve it but now that things are clicking we can we can move on a little bit something that's going to help so much with this is with step seven limit memorization with code there's all these different methods you can include in your solutions that can help you get to a solution faster however although those methods are fantastic it can make it difficult when you are in a test to know which methods to pull when and also to simply just remember them and how they operate going back to that sorting a list example there is a method for sorting a list that is simply take the array you're given in job script take the array you're given dot sort parentheses parentheses as in like open parentheses close parentheses and then boom they provide you your sorted array however that's now another method we need to memorize so instead understand how you can do it without that method being used keeping to the Basics like this will help you so so so much when we have just such a tight deadline step number eight when you go through your day of problems and you lay your head down and wake up the next day to do it all over again pick a problem from the previous day to do again because like I said it's not completely necessary to in the first few days make sure you fully know exactly how to solve each and every problem it's more necessary to understand how and why the solution you found and looked up works and make it understand for your brain and then moving on so the way to really now be able to do the problem 10 days from now is by the next day attempting it again if you still can't get it that's fine choose a different problem from the day before do this until you have at least one problem that you were able to completely solve because at the end of the 10 days you'll know that you perfectly solved 10 problems which is fantastic for the problems you didn't solve you likely understood why they were solved and how to solve them and how to think about them or at least the steps to take even if you may not remember the specific line by line solution and finally step number nine rinse and repeat steps 4 through 8 every single day for the next 10 days and that's how you'll create your lesson plan the second you don't know how something is implemented spend however long you need to for that day focusing on on it and practicing more problems just like that and then move on the next day okay everybody I hope that was really helpful if it was please let me know by leaving a like and a comment and subscribing to this Channel and yeah let me know what other questions y'all have especially as I go through this job hunt with y'all thank you so much for watching and I'll talk to you later bye"}
