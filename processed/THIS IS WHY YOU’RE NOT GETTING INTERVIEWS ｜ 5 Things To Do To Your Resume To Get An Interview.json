i provide content for new and aspiring software engineers and today we're going to talk about why you're not getting interviews yeah yes we are talking about that we're talking about how to best optimize your resume so you can make sure you do get that call so let's get to it number one the first reason you're not getting interviews is because there are no keywords in your resume now what do i mean by keywords in the job posting that the company said the posting you are applying to you have no matching keywords from what they stated as their qualifications or their responsibilities for the role etc none of those words they use are on your resume and this is really important because increasingly a i is what's being used to filter through that first round of applications and so it's going to along with other things it's going to look to see what keywords are being used and if your keywords matches the keywords on that posting and this is a very easy fix truly just pull up that job posting look under the qualifications and the responsibilities and seriously just copy and paste those words in those phrases now like let's make sure we're not lying though let's make sure we're not lying all i'm saying is make sure that if you say you are interested in front-end development in your resume and in the job posting it says must have experience in react now instead of saying front-end development say react specifically if if that is what you've used so i'm not saying to lie i'm saying make sure the way they are phrasing things the words they are using if it matches with you and your experience make sure you use those exact words and phrases number two you are not getting interviews because your address is on your resume this is something i didn't know about until long after i was done applying but it's something i've heard from multiple people from multiple recruiters and pop up when i do look for resume tips and advice and that is don't put your address or your location at all on your resume and that's because companies if they can avoid it won't want to pay for relocation yeah it's crazy and so when they see an address so far off from where their company is based or where the job will be based it's and it can sometimes be an immediate no for them now that being said i'm not saying don't get that relocation and everything but get the job first get the job first and then when talking negotiation and salary and benefits and just the whole offer package bring up relocation if you need that if you aren't in that state or anywhere near there then bring up relocation but yes the goal of the all of this is to just make sure you get that interview first make sure you then get that job first because it's a lot easier to say no to a piece of paper than it is to say no to somebody you just spent weeks and sometimes months recruiting and now you liked them they liked you you gave them the job and then now oh i need x amount of money for relocation it's a lot harder to just be like no no and then goodbye because that's a lot of resources that they spend on you on recruiting measures etc and if they can lock you down they will try their best to do that so take your address off your resume and then once you get the job bring that topic of relocation benefits stipends up number three in your resume you are being too team minded you're saying we everywhere everywhere we are my team or the company you aren't saying i me this is what i did and on one hand of course you want to show that you are team minded you are a team player and you work well in groups and you have experience working in groups but they're not hiring the group they're not hiring the group they're hiring you and this is of course a habit that can be hard to break because depending on what culture you're in the idea is oh you don't talk about yourself you don't talk about yourself if someone compliments you you end up you know boasting up the team as a whole you don't take credit for yours like it's a whole sometimes it can be a whole thing and so on your resume having to then switch up and be like me me me me it can be difficult but yes do not shy away from saying no i got that deal and i brought in x amount of dollars i put up this new technology this new xyz be that person and it's okay to mention your team but bring the focus back to you so say something like part of the xyz team where i brought in this this this where i implemented this technology and brought the team x so you can mention it and show you have experience in a team but then leave that and bring the focus back to you and this also applies to interviews don't constantly say oh my team did this what did you do but we'll get to that in a different video if you like this one and so let me know if you do number four you are not getting interviews because you are not quantifying your accomplishments now it's one thing to say brought in a lot of money for my company rather than brought in two million dollars over two quarters during the x and x establishment or whatever do you see how the second one has a lot more power to it because it's tangible it's it's one thing to be like oh i brought in a lot of x y and z it's like it's easy to brush that off it's easy to be just see that and say okay okay but when you see the numbers and the number doesn't even need to be huge it doesn't need to be two million brought in 200 dollars per quarter just add some type of number worked on a six member team where i accomplished x so make sure you where you can can quantify things don't beat around the bush y'all when it comes to resumes when it comes to interviews don't beat around the bush say exactly what you did when you did it how you did it share all of those things because it really really can make all the difference in the application and recruitment process and then lastly number five this is something that gets a bit of controversy i will say i sometimes do hear different things from different people but it is do not put your gpa on your resume now this tip applies more to the younger folks if you are just coming out of college or something like that or you don't have much work experience out of college and you're really relying a lot on the education piece of your resume don't put your gpa on there now this is something that if you had asked me i would not have given this advice to be completely honest with you but i have heard from multiple recruiters that this is something in terms of tips to make sure you get through that door this is something that you need to avoid unless your dpa is ridiculously high to not put it because it's really then only used to discount you yeah because again we're thinking about that computer and if that computer sees a certain number they're not going to say oh well they took integrated physiology and they took calculus five and so it's okay that their gpa is lower because they really applied themselves a computer and aai is not going to see that and to draw that conclusion a human might but like i said so many companies are using ai for that initial screening now and so we want to tailor our resume primarily to that and so take your gpa off and then if it is brought up in an interview again let's say you're a student or you are very newly graduated student and so the company you're interviewing for might care about that if it's brought up then share it but like i said we want them to like you first we want them to see you talk to you like you first and then ask and if it's a number lower than what they would want they still have all of this stuff all of these conversations with you all insights into who you are as a person to outweigh that maybe negative aspect of your application but we're trying to get there we're trying to get to that interview so take it off your resume unless it is ridiculously hot don't ask me what i think a ridiculously high number is again to be honest i have my gpa on my resume constantly constantly and i just stopped this a few months ago because i always thought it was something that i would be discounted for not having but recruiters say otherwise in terms of their hacks and tricks they say otherwise and sometimes on the application it will ask what your gpa was i did go through applications like that so if it asks you what it is i'm not saying lie put it on there if it doesn't ask leave it just leave it by the end of the day do what's best for you it is your professional journey that you're going through so who am i to say to go against your gut don't ever go against your gut you do you i'm just giving you some insights and some tips but the main thing i really want you all to take away from all of this is passing that a i test passing that initial screening and a lot of times this will be the reason you're not getting interviews because you're not passing the ai portion so if you are about to start applying to jobs or you're currently pull up your resume pull up your resume and ask yourself if it does pass that test and if it doesn't make some changes and i know it's so hard to change your resume constantly to make sure the keywords match with each individual job and all this i know it's so much work and it can be so tiring and so discouraging knowing you have to do all of this just to be seen but at the end of the day sometimes we still have to just play that game and do these things so that we can secure that job so there we go everybody i hope you enjoyed this video if you did
