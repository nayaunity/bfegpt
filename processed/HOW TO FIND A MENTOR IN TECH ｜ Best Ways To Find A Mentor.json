my mentor you don't need that don't get so caught up on the ward and get more focused on the relationship hello everybody my name is nyan i'm the black female engineer i provide content for new and aspiring software engineers and today we are talking about how to find a mentor specifically finding a mentor in the tech realm now if you're looking to let this be a very quick process and a one week process of finding a mentor this video is not for you because finding a mentor and cultivating that relationship takes months months and months and months because that is really how you will get the most out of the relationship so let's get to it the first thing you want to make sure you're doing is being active in the deaf community this could be from slack channels facebook groups twitter make sure you're being active in the deaf community as a whole if where you are they're providing meetups of some kind and you feel safe to do it go to those meetups i know it can be very scary to go somewhere where you know nobody believe me believe me i am not it's it's hard but it can really be what sets you up for success in trying to find a mentor and honestly also a job but that's a conversation for a different day and can really be what sets you up for success for creating and cultivating these amazing relationships linkedin and facebook are also great places to try to find a mentor facebook i really like facebook for this facebook you could literally just go in the search bar and type up women in tech or minorities in tech or underrepresented groups and all of that and you will find all of these different groups now just because that group shows up doesn't mean that they're the right one for you to see if they're the right i highly recommend just clicking on it and going through the different communications and the different posts throughout the like at least a few weeks because then you can see how active the members of that group are and you see the way they communicate are they very formal with each other is it more laid back is it really more spammy and you really won't get something out of it go through that research because we want to make sure you find exactly what you're looking for another route you can go is going on linkedin and looking up people in the profession that you want to be or in the company that you want to be in so you can search google or something like that and let's say you live in austin so google in and see who pops up and when you see someone who has the same background as you then i say message them message them and say hey my name is nya i really would like to connect with you and find out a little bit more about your story i am new into coding development and i would love to hear about what got you here because i am a black woman i would always look for black women to pop up on the linkedin search and i would also say that i would say especially being a black woman in tech i would love to hear about your experience if you're free i would love to do a 20-30 minute call honestly just ask and do this with a couple of people because sometimes people don't check their linkedin sometimes people don't want to talk to you and that's okay that's okay but try to message a few of these people at least five of these people and be on calls with them actually try to talk with them on the phone and ask them how they got here ask them about their story tell them about yourself your goals and end it with one asking for advice and also asking if you could keep up communication with them this is going to be the first step into building that mentor-mentee relationship and so asking if you can maintain communication really just helps open the door a little bit more for that relationship to happen and also ask them what groups they suggest you join what slack channels or facebook groups etc they suggest you join because then at least you have someone vouching for a certain group and you can kind of go into it a little bit with less hesitation and there's just so much out there y'all it's it it's so hard to keep up with so just asking people directly what groups they suggest can really really help with finding that right group for me i made sure to join a couple of different groups that aligned with different parts of my identity so for example me i'm a black woman in tech so the three groups i would recommend looking for is one that catered to women in tech one that catered to black people in tech and one that catered to black women in tech and so that is really what i mean by catering the groups or finding groups that catered to the different parts of your identity then when you find the ones for you be active be active it's okay to you know be a fly on the wall for a little bit and just see how things are going and everything but be active introduce yourself say hey i'm naya i am new to this and i'm really hoping to learn more about xyz any help y'all could provide or any resources y'all could recommend would be really appreciated but no introduce yourself and then just see how communication goes with different people and all of this but now make sure you're active make sure you're asking questions when you have questions about you're learning leak code problems about interviews ask those questions and also make sure you're staying up to date with this group so that you're not only active when you have a question but you're also making sure you're putting in your two cents when other people have questions because that's not cool y'all people who are just takers i've said this in different videos don't take take take like make sure we are building mutual mutually beneficial relationships and as you are active in these groups if you see people that you would like to learn more about simply just ask me like hey i would love to speak with some of y'all about how you got to where you are today if you are free please let me know i would like a 20 to 30 minute call now that being said with facebook groups there are groups for learning and then there are groups for just the dev world in general so if you're in a strictly learning group like 100 days of code i think that's what it is 100 days of code or something like that that may not be the best place to go for asking for advice and insights because everyone around you is in the same place as you do you see what i'm saying if everyone is learning html and css no one can really tell you how they got to their spot at google because no one's there yet so make sure you also are keeping in mind who your audience is oh and let me just say don't get so caught up on the word mentor you don't need to ask hey can you be my mentor you don't need that don't get so caught up on the ward and get more focused on the relationship because the word means nothing to be completely honest the word doesn't mean much unless you're part of an actual mentoring program that is what it has defined itself as other than that don't get so caught up on the word and really think about the relationships because people can also kind of get a little bit more hesitant to assist if you ask can you be my mentor because they may think they're not in the place they would like to be to help to to be that for somebody and yet if you had an ass they would have been able to provide you all these resources so don't get so caught up on the word i'm just using this word because that is really kind of the role that they would be but that doesn't mean you have to ask you have to say mentor but no keep on with this pattern of talking to people reaching out to them having calls and it's it can be an exhausting process it can be very time consuming but honestly that's how you get the best results basically that's how where when it's time for you to start looking for a job people will feel more comfortable referring you to a job where people will feel more comfortable saying hey we actually just got a opening how about you apply so don't say to yourself oh i'll start looking for mentor when i start looking for a job no it's best to start this as soon as possible because that way when it's time that you really need something like a job you have already cultivated these robust relationships with people and that's why i say this is not a one week process or whatever this this takes time but can end up so rewarding afterwards because now once you get the job you still would want somebody to kind of assist you into that transition of going from learning to code to being a developer yourself and how should i do this how should i talk to managers how should i do x y and z and so having someone more experienced than you kind of show you the ropes whether or not they are part of the company you just got hired for it helps a lot especially because in software engineering people move around a lot people hop from place to place and so in a couple of months in a year and two years you need a new job you have all these allies on your side who would be willing to help you lift you from where you are and take you to this new place so that's why it's so important to find a mentor somebody anyway i hope this helped let me know if it did let me know what questions you have down below in the comments like and subscribe and i will see you all later bye"}
