{"video_title": "I WISH I HAD DONE THIS BEFORE I COMMITTED \uff5c 5 Things To Do Before Choosing A Coding Bootcamp", "transcript": "hello everybody my name is nya and i'm the black female engineer and today we are going to be talking about the five things you need to do and look at before really honing down on a coding boot camp before you sign that offer before making that commitment here are some five things you may not have thought of to look at to really make sure that you are getting the most of your experience and at the end of it all get a job so the first thing that you really need to look at when choosing a coding bootcamp is look at the timing of the program look at the timing of the program like such as the length but also when you would be set to graduate so for me i started my coding boot camp in june of 2020 and i graduated in october very early october of that same year so it's a four-month program and i graduated in the fall so for me that was great because a lot of companies hire in the fall however some of my peers who graduated later on kind of ran into some difficulties when it came to the hiring process because they graduated in the winter they would have started let's say july august and they were set to graduate december january and the thing is with that time period companies aren't really hiring as much because that's their you know their year end they're focusing on their books they're focusing on closing things down etc so when you really look at really the trend of hiring hiring is lower in those months and so it took them longer it has taken them to get jobs and get offers and things like that and so me when i was looking at you know when to start and everything i really didn't put this into consideration i was like you know what like let me just start this is when you know the earliest time is let me sign me up sign up but if i had known this ahead of time i that definitely could have impacted my decision making depending on when i decided to make that career shift so just something to think about so piggybacking off that first tip tip number two is to look at the length of the program coding bootcamps can run in anywhere between like three months to six months to a year mine was four so kind of between that three to six month term however if you have certain goals of okay i want to make sure i get to this this by this date and this date really look at how long it will take you to complete your boot camp experience and with that if it is a longer term like the 12 month one or even maybe 18 months really look down at the curriculum they'll be covering and then to what depth because it's important to know what you're getting into in terms of not only the boot camp experience but also what is supposed to be taught and make sure that you're not learning things that aren't of interest to you in those extra you know extra months and everything because okay cool is 12 months so you'll get more knowledge but is it the knowledge that you really are looking for is it the you know will it be the job category you're looking for or xyz so really look at the term and what is going to be covered within those terms and if you just go to the coding bootcamps site whatever one you're interested in they typically do have a course breakdown sometimes it's not too in detail but they do have a course breakdown of what's supposed to be covered when and if you can actually talk to one of their recruiters and things like that i'm sure they would be more than willing to give you even more details so really really keep that in mind so tip number three you really want to look at the repayment plan of your bootcamp so yeah bootcamp is expensive it it very much is and so again i'm talking about more less obvious tips and things to consider because of course you would consider you know the cost and everything but after you consider the cost and after you see how to really you know finance it will you be taking out a loan where you'll be doing an income share agreement will you be paying out of pocket things like that look at really what the repayment plan is specifically if you are choosing a loan or an income share agreement so just to break it down real quick an income share agreement also known as like isa that's actually what i decided to choose for my bootcamp and really it's just that when you get a job when you you know secure a position you are going to start paying let's say like five percent 10 15 of your paycheck to the boot camp directly until you pay them back what they let you conquer like borrow this is different from a loan because alone one that could be a private loan that you went to your own bank for and things like that and so they'll have their own terms you'll need to look at the interest rate you'll need to look at at what time do you need to start paying them back is it a month after graduation two months or is it during the actual bootcamp that you need to also actually be paying them back and things like that so you can go through your bank or i do know if bootcamp is that give you a loan directly and it can be different from an income share agreement because the rates can be different sometimes with a loan depending on your credit it can be um the rates can be lower so you want to look at your credit also when it's when deciding between an income share agreement and a loan but with a loan also it's not dependent on how much you're making an income share agreement is dependent on how much you're making as an engineer if i'm making forty thousand dollars post group boot camp versus making a hundred thousand dollars post boot camp there's different percentages i would need to pay back to them each month rather than alone it's 300 every month like where you at like bring that to us if you don't care if you're making two thousand bucks a month twenty thousand bucks we don't care just give us back the three hundred so there are some nuances and things like that so really away from just the cost of the boot camp really look at the repayment plan what they expect of you when they expect of it how much what proportion they expect of it each month each year things like that really look at those details tip number four the next thing you really want to look at before committing to a boot camp is look at their employment rate after graduation really look at how many of their students get a job after they complete the program not only that but in what time period do they get a job if it's saying you know 80 percent employed after a year that's very different from employed after six weeks look at those um stats and also look at like look at the notes is it employed in specific and actual software engineering roles or were they not able to get a job in software engineering and they ended up going back to like business or finance or like being a driver for like uber or like things like that like when you say employed do you mean as a software engineer or just disemployed just employed at the trader joe's across the street just employed so really really look at that fine detail because this is your life like you are making a huge sacrifice not only in time but so much money and so much effort based on what these people are telling you so really look at that fine print and if they don't offer fine print again call up that recruiter call up that office and be like yo what do you mean by 80 data like i need to know really the fine fine print and the details surrounding this statement so tip number five kind of going along with chapter number four with tip number five if the boot camp you're looking at states some type of employment guarantee really again look at that fine print so what i mean by this mine says something like employment guaranteed after three months period so okay if i go through this boot camp and you know i do the thing i will have a job after three months and there was also another thing that said and if that's not the case then you get a 100 refund so really there's really like no like risk to you it's you pay this and get a job or you pay this and get the refund because you couldn't get a job so i'm like hell yeah like like don't gotta tell me tries like where's the pen but the thing is though when companies state this look at the requirements that need to be fulfilled in order for you to qualify for money back in the event that you don't get a job so with my bootcamp yo there was a laundry list of things that you needed to complete you needed to do or not do to make sure that you would end up getting that refund if you know you don't get the job their whole mindset is if you do every single thing on this list then you will get a job and so it went beyond just like going to classes and completing the assessments and you know calling it a day it went into like like contact you know linkedin members x times a week and write blog posts you know x times you know a month and all this like things that you wouldn't think directly related to the course but in terms of getting a job they were like if you do all of this all of these things then you will get a job and if you don't then here's your money back when you pick well one before you even pick a boot camp look at this laundry list of things is it feasible to do is it some of it absurd is it things that you're not comfortable doing like writing blog posts or reaching out to people on linkedin if you know you're more of an introvert or things like that look at that laundry list of things before signing on to a program because you're guaranteed a job and two if you decide that you know what like i'll do whatever it takes you know and that was me i'll do whatever it takes to get a job i don't care if you know you say i need to jog around the block two times a week for me to even to qualify for the refund like i would do it but but print it out print out that entire statement of all the things you need to do for you to qualify for that refund because some of the things are actually during your courses not even after you've you know graduated but during your courses you need to make sure that you know three weeks in you do x y and z you make sure that five weeks then you do x y and z and if the first time you're looking at this list is after you've graduated then boom you're already don't qualify for the refund because you didn't do the things you're supposed to during your program so before you even start the boot camp print that list out hang it up on the wall and be making sure you're crossing things out and constantly looking at it and making sure that you are fulfilling all of those requirements so there you have it everybody the five things that you really really really need to look at before signing on to a coding bootcamp to ensure that you get the most of your experience and you know you get what you paid for so hopefully that's you know a job or even if it's not a job but you being able to start your own company and things like that you want to make sure you're getting what you pay for so thank you so much and please let me know what you
