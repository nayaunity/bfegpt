{"video_title": "BEING A NEW DEVELOPER AT A NEW JOB \uff5c Learning a New Programming Language \uff5c 30 Day Reflection", "transcript": "that's why i really wanted this to be honest and actually on that point if you've stayed long enough to this part of the video i'm going to reward you with this story that i was not planning on sharing hello everybody my name is nayan i'm the black female engineer i provide content for new and inspiring software engineers and today we're going into my one month reflection of working at dreamworks so i started working at dreamworks animation studios uh yeah about a solid month ago i'm working on the production engineering team basically they provide products and tools to be used internally so it doesn't really go outside to y'all but they help with the movie development and animations and whatnot of the company so i've been working there a couple of weeks now so definitely not a long time at all and so really this reflection is going to be more first impressions just how these first few weeks have been and if you follow me on instagram you may know what's coming um if you don't follow me at the black female engineer but yes it's been a lot of ups and downs and so i'm going to go through this category by category so i'm not just spilling my guts everywhere and so first i'll start with first impressions of the team the team demographically is definitely better than the team i worked on before this the team i worked on before this it was i was the only woman on the team and i black person in general and so with this team it's about eight of us now that i think i've never really sat and counted the squares on the zoom call but it's about eight of us and three are women including me yes including me there's three women and yeah that's really all there is to it in terms of age group the men are definitely more experienced and the women the women are including me more not new new but just a couple of years in from what it looks like so there is age diversity which is good in any team and when it comes to ethnic diversity that's when to be honest it gets harder for me to analyze because it's not very i was gonna say it's not very black and white but no it's not very clear cut there's no clear way to tell really but from my inference it's kind of the same makes mix of like three of the eight maybe four of they so maybe 40 to 50 percent being ethnically uh different than the caucasian ethnicity everyone seems chill to if chill means that you just do your job and go home if that makes sense like no one is going to pester you about something no one's going to breathe down your neck about something they're not you know high maintenance like everyone's like hey like this is the job and clocking clock out goodbye and so i do like that personally because i don't really like the mentality of this work is my life and this work is all i do ever and i am my work and so i'm not a fan of those kinds auras and vibes uh whether that those be the company-wide vibes i'm sure a few of us can think of companies known for that type of mentality like we are family like no no you're not and so i do like that that seems to be the consensus of like yeah get in do your job get out goodbye and maybe i'll see you again tomorrow maybe i won't because i'm gonna call in and it'll be fine because no one really cares about that thing here and so that's actually been really cool to see like people just say like yeah i'm gonna be out tomorrow i didn't sleep well so sorry so i do kind of like that i think that also comes with being salaried being just like hey well i have my work done so i'm gonna be at the beach and i think that's great personally like we do your work i don't see why you should sit here for six more hours so no i i do think that the team is very cheap now going into the work i'm going to talk more about this in a later video but basically yeah my team builds apps and products to be used by other animators and you know studio production and whatnot and so that's that's really the extent of it it'll never go out into the world some of the apps they build are web apps some of the apps are way more complex than that i'm trying my best to just learn what they build what each app's purpose is what their apis look like and just figure just get more acquainted with everything i think that's just going to be the theme of this video like i'm just trying to get more acquainted and to learn as much as i can and so yeah i've been working for about four weeks now and last week was my highest slash like only coding week to kind of give you an idea of the speed in which i'm integrating onto this team i don't know if that's super fast i don't know if that's super slow for me i i'm kind of anxious about it because i'm like oh my gosh like come on i feel like i'm not doing anything i'm not contributing because i don't know i feel like those of you have been on this channel for a while know or can kind of sense that that's who i am like hey like let's do this like what can i do to help let me be you know useful let me earn the money you're paying me and whatnot and so that's definitely been a huge point of anxiety for me and so yeah last week was the first week i really coded but that being said it wasn't code for was the word it wasn't code for enhancing an app or anything it was more like data analysis so it was more data analysis type coding so i've been coding in python i've never used python before but that's what uh my team that's one of the languages my team uses they use python they use c plus they use a little bit of java and so yeah i've been learning trying to learn python and i was using python to complete this task i had not because i needed python to complete it because i could have just completed it via an excel document but python can help with it you know what i mean it can help filter things it can help find things it can help saying okay so for this set of data only give me these specific data points and so that's what i mean when i say i wasn't actually enhancing anything any one of their products i was really just on a task of like hey audit these things and so i'm like okay cool and i just pulled up vs code it was auditing via vs code looking at what my terminal ran back what my code ran back and using that to fill out the deliverables i'm set to give at the end of the assignment i'm glad i took the coding off because it forces me to learn that much more and faster especially in a low risk environment where it's not a product i'm trying to enhance and so if i mess up some code it'll just be like oh i messed up let me actually instead use this to get the right thing and it's not like a big production failure or something i hope what i'm saying makes sense because while i'm talking i'm like ah maybe it doesn't but yes that's what i was doing this last week another point i i feel like i should have said this earlier so i have been having a lot of anxiety like i said at work part of it i don't think has helped by me not really having the support that is uh what's the word the support that's expected my second week there my manager left to get married you know freaking selfish so yes he loved to get married has been gone for two weeks and so did my appointed mentor slash buddy on the team who's also one of the women on the team she left as well to go visit her parents also selfish again i don't know what these people are doing and so yes that's been my situation where i've really just been like where am i i don't know who to ask especially because okay that's also been hard because everyone on the team kind of has their own thing their own product their own assignments they don't it's not a team where everyone is working together on the same product it's and that's really how it was on in my last job here it's really like every one person has like their own app their own product xyz yes there's some collaboration here and there when you need help and whatnot but really it's like one person owns something and so that's been hard knowing who to go to because i'm like oh okay well i need help with this but okay let me look up the roster and figure out who owns this thing and whatnot and so that's made things hard and with my manager being gone also not knowing who to ask for who is what like has this been a lot of gray areas and so that definitely has contributed to my anxiety because my manager is actually coming back for from day i'm filming on sunday you will watch this either tuesday or friday i'm not sure we'll see but you'll watch this either too the following tuesday or friday today is sunday and my manager is coming back tomorrow mo monday for me so by the time you watch this my manager's back and i am so stressed out because i'm like he's gonna come back and i have nothing to show i have nothing to show for his week's gone and so i'm really fighting the urge to not work right now so that my task is complete because what i was working on all of last week i was hoping to be done by friday but there's so many data points there's millions of millions like tons of data points and again if you follow me on instagram you know that that was a big thing um for me one of these days where i'm like ah there's so much data points i had said on my instagram that was like 500 000. no that that was 500 000 for one like thing for one project i was going through and it turns out that was like the smallest project it looks like all the other projects have millions of data points and so you if you saw my computer struggling that day like that's where i've been and so i have the you know code and program that i've written to swift through this data points and give me the information i need but it's just taking forever where friday i just sat there just and running like four terminals running the background trying to do four different programs and i know that doesn't help things go quicker but i was just like i i strategically did it where it wouldn't be the slowest but it also wasn't the fastest i was just trying to finish before my manager gets here and of course that didn't happen i have about two more projects i need to run data through but i was just like ah my gosh so i'm really finding the urge to not work right now and just run and not even it wouldn't even be working here i am justifying me working on a sunday but i wouldn't really be working i just need to run the terminal in the background for the next like six hours because yeah it took like eight hours for me to go through about two projects on friday and so and i only have two left so i'm fighting that urge anyway i kind of went through a rabbit hole there but anyway that has yes contributed to a lot of flusteredness that you can i'm sure see here and what not but you know brighter days ahead so overall what i've been doing what i plan to continue doing for at least the next two months is just asking to shadow people doing their job like i literally don't care if it directly relates to what i'm doing i just need to understand better how you go through these tickets what you look at when you go through these tickets when i say tickets i mean when we get assigned something so hey you have to fix this bug or you need to enhance this program and whatnot those requests come through the form of tickets we use jira and so those handle slash house all of the tickets we have and each different team members assignments and so when i say ticket i really mean assignment and so yeah seeing how other people go through those tickets of okay so the first thing you look at is this and then the next thing you look at is this and then this is how you iterate through your process and whatnot because i've seen that even if it doesn't have anything to do with your current project it's still helpful to understand what type of mentality you should employ what type of work process you should have because i'm brand new you know like i just picked up coding a year ago and so i'm still brand spanking you and i'm still getting a hang of just that coding process when it comes to a work environment and so just seeing that is very helpful and so i've been doing that trying to see like hey do you have time i you know would love to just sit with you and just be a fly on the wall to share your screen and i'll certainly just sit here i'll just be writing in my notebook writing on my whiteboard and that's it and i just watch you and with being you that that's one thing i'll say for any of y'all who are about to be new or new currently or just started a job take advantage of that people expect should expect you to know nothing when you start on a job and so do you know the saying like oh like no question is a dumb question we all know that's a lie i i to me i always feel like that's a lie like i feel like there are dumb questions and i will be judged by asking certain questions but when you're brand new one month two months three months in ask every question they don't truly know what you should know and so to them no question really is dumb because they don't know if you should know it or not because your brand's picking you and so take advantage of that and just say like hey i just want to watch you or hey what's x y and z bother the crap out of them because if they go back to your supervisors or your managers or your product directors or whatever saying oh yeah like she asked too many questions that's not gonna go anywhere you know what i mean and so and one they wouldn't do that but two even if they did that wouldn't go anywhere they would turn out looking like so basically that's what i'm saying maybe i shouldn't say that because i'm about to be monetized in like a couple of days anyway anyway just take advantage of that newness like crazy and bother every single body because at the end of the day i'm trying to make sure that you know i survive another day and if you're annoyed by my questions honestly i'd rather you be annoyed by my questions than me not have a job so yes that's where i am right now if you see the flustered nature of this video know that it's a thousand times worse for me in person and i'm not saying that to scare anybody anyone who knows me on a personal level knows that i can really drive myself into a hole by the anxiety i put on myself and so it's been like my mom and friends being like girl like they expect you to be new chill out calm down like you're doing the best you can and they know that and they see that so just calm down they expect you to know nothing so give them what they want no nothing for now and then later you will slowly continue to grow i just really wanted this to be honest i didn't want to talk about flowers and rainbows and sunshine especially because i don't know i feel like sometimes doing that aids in more harm than it does in benefiting people because then you watching this and if you're in a situation where you're new and you're struggling and i'm over here like i'm doing great i have built three apps and i'm actually going to be an animator for one of the movies and theaters out tomorrow like that doesn't help you because now you feel like you are the problem when that is not the case and so that's why i really wanted this to be honest and actually on that point if you've stayed long enough to this part of the video i'm going to reward you with this story that i was not planning on sharing so about a week and a half ish ago like my program manager set up a meeting with like all of us newbies and so we're on the call and yeah everyone's like yeah like how's everyone we're all on different teams so we're not all on the same team but we're all on different teams only in different locations different x y and z but it's like yeah how's everyone doing and their new roles x y and z and i you know i'm just like scoping it out like how honest can i be here and so i'm just scoping it out and everyone was like wow i'm doing amazing i have coded 300 lines of code i just you know put up these commits and i'm doing x y and z and so they get to me and i don't say like oh my gosh i'm so stressed out and anxious and like x y and z but i was just like oh yeah i'm trying to learn you know um it's it's coming it's coming along um hopefully i tell you i can tell you more next week and so that happened the call ends and i'm sitting at my desk literally about to burst into tears about to just burst into tears because i felt like that of like oh my gosh so i'm the only one having trouble with this i'm the only one having struggles with learning and transitioning into this new team and so i like sat there especially head down and just had to physically suck my tears back in so i was like no like we are not doing this we are not crying like naya you should be in this growth learn mindset and so no don't be hard on yourself and statue just throw the tears back into my eyeballs and not let them hit the floor um but yeah i just wanted to share that in case you are in that situation or you find yourself in that situation and it just i wanted to share it to further show how harmful telling why i'm not telling i'm not saying those people were lying but how harmful if they were lying or they were over exaggerating their productivity and whatnot how harmful it can be for the people i.e me around them and so that's another reason why i just want this to be extremely honest i am very much in this anxious space very much stressed out about if i'm doing enough right now and it is a really big point of struggle for me right now and i'm really hoping that as the weeks and months go on i can calm myself down and i think in general i just need to learn to calm myself down no matter what because to be honest even if i'm six months a year in i can't imagine a time where i'm not stressing myself out about not being fast enough with a ticket or asking too many questions or xyz i truly can't imagine myself not being stressed out and anxiety-written about those things and so to me the problem is more focused on my mindset on those things rather than the situation at hand if that makes sense i'm not i think i need to instead work on bettering my mentality when it comes to working in general when it comes to being on a team in general when it comes to coding in general just being better with my mentality and being kinder to myself in general that's all i say about that i hope this video is not 30 000 minutes long if it is well that's what we'll have to do with it and i hope in general you all got something out of this and enjoyed it somehow i hope it wasn't too depressing or anything but yeah i hope you all enjoyed this and i will see you all later please like and subscribe but thank you thank you bye"}
